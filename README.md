# How to pick a Tech School

For this project, we scraped a Tech Bootcamp Review Site (with a script provided by the instructor) and then proceeded to query the created database using SQL (through the Python library SQLAlchemy) to choose the best school for each kind of prospective student.

Done in the context of the OCT 2022 Ironhack Lisboa Data Analytics Bootcamp
