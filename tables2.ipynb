Never learned so many important key concepts and technologies before in my life in such a short timespan.

JavaScript is absolutely key and the prowess you gain is immense. Never at any point did something I learn feel like: \"Yeah, we just do it because it\\'s in the curriculum.\" - Everything was relevant for the job and really all modules complemented each other perfectly. However, I must say that the lectures and live codealongs were very energy draining due to the length (like 6-7 hours at a time) and the homework just put alot of extra workload on the students\\' backs. My eyes really hurt from the long screentime, although I\\'m super used to work computer jobs.

I expected something like a 40-45 hr week, but ended up getting more like a 60-hour-work-week (including weekends). For fast students it will feel like you are being slowed down by less advanced students, often there is no way to learn the lesson for the day self-paced/self-guided, though you could sometimes get permission to do that. The teacher\\'s assistants are alumni, and if you are their first cohort, you will sometimes know that it\\'s first time, when troubleshooting doesn\\'t go that smoothly. If you are unlucky, it can sometimes not feel like the most professional experience. Otherwise, the organization is well run, the managers and lead teachers are super open to feedback and adapt quickly, everyone was always super friendly, polite and patient. For anyone who is willing to sacrifice a lot of energy, some health and social life for 3 months to go from zero to hero – DO IT. The experience was extremely rewarding, but also comes at a price.

They are far more productive and rewarding.Read Less\",\n",

Pros: • The bootcamp structure allows you to retrain in a couple of months. • The quality and quantity of the learning resources (courses, etc.) is great. • In Paris (the only Ironhack campus I know), the teaching team is incredible, kind and understanding. • You work on projects, bridging the gap between theory and practice. • You are in a student environment (even though the final project is for a real client), and that allows you to fail and learn. Your fellow students will be one of your strengths. Cons: • The bootcamp is intensive, the pace is steady and fast, you need to know that (and to know yourself) before jumping into such a course. It is much better to have a stable and supportive personal environment when you start a bootcamp like this one. Be prepared, and manage your energy &amp; time, it\\'s a both a marathon and a sprint. • There\\'s a lot to learn in a small amount of time, you have to love learning (and to be able to stay attentive in a classroom environment). • If you struggle with digital tools and concepts, you will be hindered by this.

I want to share with you some<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> of the main insights after having lived this experience. PROS • The Ironhack crew is incredible, everyone is kind and understanding, and always open to help. • They emphasize the importance of mental health during the Bootcamp, I really appreciated that. • You have a lot of documentation for all of the different topics touched during the Bootcamp. • Careerhack guidelines and tools are on top. CONS • The pace is fast! Keep in mind that it will feel like jumping from one thing to the next, but at some point everything will connect, trust me. • The format is not adapted to different types of learning. The motto is \"learn by doing\", which is great! But if you are a person who learns differently, it might be a little hard for you to grasp the info, since it can be a lot to take in. • If it is your first time interacting with subjects like Design Thinking, Lean, etc... It can be a little overwhelming. • If you have never used any design software (like Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.), you may take a little longer to understand with Figma. I suggest practicing and discovering the software on your own before the Bootcamp. SUGGESTIONS • Organize your days. Do you consider yourself an unorganized person? Find a method that works for you, otherwise, you\\'ll find yourself overwhelmed with many To-Dos. • Take time for yourself. Find time to do those things that recharge your energy because, as I just mentioned in the previous point, you can easily find yourself feeling overwhelmed. • If you have time before the Bootcamp, use it! Go through all the Careerhack tasks, this will make your life easier later. Also, I would definitely contact Alumni to learn about CVs, LinkedIn, Portfolios, or even ask about topics and tools that you don\\'t know or would like to know better. If you do all these things in advance, you\\'ll save a lot of time and feel less overwhelmed. You will learn many things (I hope) and have the opportunity to connect with amazing people with completely different backgrounds and personalities. Find and use methods that work for you, ask for help if needed, keep in mind that communication and empathy will be very important, and enjoy the ride because even though it feels like it will never end, it will. So to conclude, personally this Bootcamp meant a lot to me, academically, professionally, and personally. It helped me get back on track, I learned a lot even though I already knew the tools we were using, and I met incredible people!

However, there are some ways to improve the experience : - In fact, I would have prefer the lead teacher not to be remote (even if he was very available) - Only 1 teacher assistant for 12 persons was not enough as the lead teacher is not present during the afternoon labs (and I understood that there is normally 1 TA for 10 persons) - People can choose their projects team and I don\\'t think it is the best option because you can easily find yourself in a group with a very low level and as nobody is really able to lead it, it\\'s frustrating and you have to ask help from the teacher all the time.

It is sad we did not work more practical exercises related to UX/UI Design that we can have during job interviews.

Also, if you ask him a question, either verbal or written, he cannot understand what you are asking him, he cannot answer the question. It happened very often we asked him the same question in 1283091238901 different ways, just to understand what we are asking him and he again either says that he does not understand the questions or starts talking nonsense. Things that have nothing to do with the question. Example: Question: Hey Ignacio, how to clean this data? Answer: It’s very important to clean your data. OR I don\\'t understand what you\\'re asking ################################################################################################# It flows from topic to topic. Very often while talking about one topic he turns to another or goes back explaining some things he forgot to say, but we talked about them 2 hours ago and now he remembered to say them. Let me give you a similar example that will help us understand what I mean. Let\\'s imagine that we have a task to cook a pizza. I guess most of the people reading this post know how to cook pizza and that\\'s why I chose this example. Here\\'s how Ignacio Soretas would explain how to cook a pizza. Example: Once you bought the dough from the store now roll it out and start making a pizza, then Michael Jackson was a very famous singer of the time, I forgot to tell you that he had no children, take the pizza out of the oven and eat. This was an example that contained words and objects that are close to our daily lives. It was easy to detect the catch, but now imagine he is talking about stuff you hear for the first time like data analysis, statistics etc... It’s impossible to understand what he means, but he left you with confusion with many questions. ################################################################################################# 2. Curriculum The simplest and most basic things we all need to know we’re not explained. Things like how to create a table (Data Frame) in Pandas (Python library used to operate with data). How to fill this table with information. How to change the values in the table and other basic stuff. The biggest downside is that they didn\\'t teach us to THINK like a data analyst, they didn\\'t teach us how to ask questions and how to check them, through the data, how to clean data, and many many more. ################################################################################################# Also, the exercises we had to do were not well structured and are not suitable for beginners. Task descriptions are very bad, it is difficult to understand what they want from us even for a person who is a native English speaker. Very often the exercises included tasks that were not adequate for everyday life. Things that have nothing to do with us. Difficult to assimilate and thus further complicate the understanding of the task. For example, things like some Pokemons and similar cartoon characters. We had the task to process a table with the characteristics of Pokemon and draw conclusions about them. Like ‘Who is the strongest Pokemon?’. As you can guess for people who have never seen this cartoon and have no idea about Pokemon, the difficulty of the task increases. Once because you do not understand what information the table contains and second because you do not understand how the code work, with which you are trying to process the table. It would be much better if the exercises contained things that are much closer to the problems in real life, things that we encounter every day, such as tables with information about food and so on. ################################################################################################# The lectures were nothing more than reading aloud, and there was nothing of added value. Not to mention that there were days when the lectures lasted about 4-5 hours from 9 to 14:00 in the afternoon and after such a long listening nothing remains in your head. The information should be conveyed in small steps and at small intervals, not a lot of information together. ################################################################################################# Often they said to us that if we had questions we should ask Google or our teammates and if we failed then we would ask for help from the assistant or the teacher. Well, this brings us automatically to the question if I have to ask my classmates or Google then why did I pay you more than 7K euros? ################################################################################################# SQL is the number 1 required skill to find a job as a data analyst, well we learn it only for one week… but spend 3 weeks in ML doing something that nobody understands, and nobody will hire us to make a model that we don’t understand how they work. Tableau is the number 2 required skill to find a job as a data analyst but we learn it only one day! ONLY ONE DAY, yes you read right ONLY ONE DAY! ################################################################################################# 3. Job support is even worst. I will tell you only that few months later I can’t find a job in the analytics field, and I will end there, hopefully, I helped you to understand what are the hidden costs of taking a Bootcamp at Ironhack. ################################################################################################# Of course, there are many more bullshits around them but yea, that’s enough for now. As a summary! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK!

But the bootcamp overall was a good experience, I experienced it in hybrid mode online and I can attend physically, it wasn’t that bad, sometimes annoying for working in groups but it was a super interesting experience, as for the bootcamp gained knowledge, I feel there is room for improvement but doesn’t mean it’s bad, it’s actually very good but still can be improved further and it will be top of the top to be honest, the staff are super super friendly, man I can’t emphasise how good and amazing they were, as a new expat that was very important to me and so were the students, my design squad hopefully we will stay friends for life, the campus man, I want to live there, top tbh top, that’s all pros I guess, I’ll add up some cons shortly but overall I loved the experience and gained knowledge, anyone with previous knowledge, throw that aside and learn from the start then connect, you’ll never learn enough with a half filled cup, empty the cup, learn then mix it up and flood yourself with knowledge. As for me tbh, I come from a design background so the first two weeks was very hard to work with others who knew nothing so be patient we are all there to learn. Another thing is the hybrid mode, I personally loved it, if it’s any problem to you, you can attend there and do online together but if you’re not a fan then wait until it goes back to normal hopefully soon crossed fingers. As for the bootcamp all in all, I would advise people who want such thing and have some problems committing to study on their own specially, this will be good for you, plus you’ll be certified. My only problem tbh, might not be my only one, it is while I’m writing this because just top of my mind, I know it’s long sorry hehe, the money, kind of expensive tbh specially that I got a couple of promotions and I wasn’t allowed to apply them together, some people paid more, some paid less, some didn’t pay at all they got full scholarships, which felt weird to be honest, but alas we were there to learn so doesn’t matter but it would have felt way better if it was a little cheaper than it is now, at least that’s my judgment, I come from another country where salaries are way less and the economy barely equates so might be only me but my opinion haa.

But the bootcamp overall was a good experience, I experienced it in hybrid mode online and I can attend physically, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad, sometimes annoying for working in groups but it was a super interesting experience, as for the bootcamp gained knowledge, I feel there is room for improvement but doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s bad, it&rsquo;s actually very good but still can be improved further and it will be top of the top to be honest, the staff are super super friendly, man I can&rsquo;t emphasise how good and amazing they were, as a new expat that was very important to me and so were the students, my design squad hopefully we will stay friends for life, the campus man, I want to live there, top tbh top, that&rsquo;s all pros I guess, I&rsquo;ll add up some cons shortly but overall I loved the experience and gained knowledge, anyone with previous knowledge, throw that aside and learn from the start then connect, you&rsquo;ll never learn enough with a half filled cup, empty the cup, learn then mix it up and flood yourself with knowledge. As for me tbh, I come from a design background so the first two weeks was very hard to work with others who knew nothing so be patient we are all there to learn. Another thing is the hybrid mode, I personally loved it, if it&rsquo;s any problem to you, you can attend there and do online together but if you&rsquo;re not a fan then wait until it goes back to normal hopefully soon crossed fingers. As for the bootcamp all in all, I would advise people who want such thing and have some problems committing to study on their own specially, this will be good for you, plus you&rsquo;ll be certified. My only problem tbh, might not be my only one, it is while I&rsquo;m writing this because just top of my mind, I know it&rsquo;s long sorry hehe, the money, kind of expensive tbh specially that I got a couple of promotions and I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to apply them together, some people paid more, some paid less, some didn&rsquo;t pay at all they got full scholarships, which felt weird to be honest, but alas we were there to learn so doesn&rsquo;t matter but it would have felt way better if it was a little cheaper than it is now, at least that&rsquo;s my judgment, I come from another country where salaries are way less and the economy barely equates so might be only me but my opinion haa.

After getting through the bootcamp came the fun part of job hunting and it was an extremely painless process thanks to being shown how to job hunt correctly, and I owe that to my outcomes manager Brito (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbrito1/). He was extremely thorough and provided me with tons of resources to make the job finding process easy and simple. I know I couldn't have gotten the job I have today if it weren't for Brito and his help/connections. He always held me accountable and that's the most important part of the whole process as an up and coming Developer. Overall Ironhack was the best decision of my life, I went from someone who was working in the food industry and coding as a hobby to working a full time job as a Developer for a great company and I wouldn't change a thing.Read Less\",\n",

I couldn’t be more wrong! Although the pre-work seemed a lot, I had only started to scratch the surface of what is needed to become a full stack developer. The bootcamp is only 9 weeks long but it felt more like 9 months because if you want to follow the pace you have to dedicate all your time and energy to it (nights and weekends included!). The structure of the bootcamp is as follows: every morning you learn new concepts and skills, every afternoon you do a guided project - called \"lab\" - to put the lesson into practice. The labs are challenging and put you in real life work situations so it’s a fantastic way to learn. There are sometimes solo labs, sometimes group labs so you can practice working on your own as well as with a team of developers. At the end of every 2 weeks, you have 1 week to develop a project of your own with a couple of teammates to test your skills and start building your portfolio. During the entire bootcamp you get the support of super skilled teachers. They always look for the right balance between helping you when you get stuck on a problem and letting you find the solution for yourself so that you do not only learn to blindly apply concepts but genuinely understand them. Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Ironhack. Yes, it’s been intense but I could not have learned this much in such a short time with another format.

You learn very valuable skills you only learn by actually doing, trying, falling, rising and working together. No matter what your entry... Read More level is, the mentors always were sure you were not left behind and were very patient and willing to explain it until the whole class understood. I felt always very safe to ask any questions, which is very important to me. Instead of the bootcamp on location, I attent the remote cohort. At Ironhack they really know how to organized remote classes. It was a good balance between classes, tasks and self learning. Even remote, every one was always involved in the classes throughout the day. And there was no room for slacking :) , which I also very much like. Make sure you do not plan anything at all these three months. It will be 100% bootcamp which I was grateful for afterwards. Besides learning, we also build up a bond within the class. In the end it felt like friends that I still speak after the bootcamp was done. The Ironhack community is a big pro of (and after) the bootcamp. I thought about it for a long time, and just did it. I left comfortable en secure job for this bootcamp, and did not regret it at all.Read Less',\n",

I was very hesitant at first to join any sort of bootcamp. I looked into it a few years ago and compared them all. I weighed pros and cons<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> and in the end always thought I could make it without the help of a bootcamp so I just waited and pretended that I would start the job search eventually but two years later I was still unemployed. I got an email from OfferUp announcing their partnership with Ironhack and it piqued my interest. I gave it a shot and won a partial scholarship which was enough to offset the interest fees from the loan. I was also able to get approved for the loan by one of their financing partners despite having a very poor credit score and high credit utilization which was a blessing! As the title of my review says, I had already been programming since I was a teenager. I\\'ve worked on several multiplayer game mods and even created games, programs and websites of my own. Being self-taught is great! There was one big drawback however; I could not find a job. My resume was awful, I did not know how to network nor the true importance of networking. I had no clue how to sell myself or how to talk to recruiters. It was obvious to me that joining a bootcamp would not make me gain any significant technical skills considering my extensive background. I already had a fair understanding of the material being taught and could have brushed up those skills within a week or two. So why did I join Ironhack? Simply for the one and only Daniel Brito from Ironhack\\'s Career services. Throughout the bootcamp, I was able to schedule one-on-one meetings with him in order to discuss my career goals as well as get advice on how to approach certain companies and very good interview preparation help. I always had so many questions prepared for him yet I only needed to ask him one question and he would predict my next 2-3 questions and answer them in advance. He really knows his stuff! As soon as Brito walked us through updating our LinkedIn profiles, I was assaulted by recruiters left and right and didn\\'t know what to do. He pointed me in the right direction, told me what to watch out for and what to expect. He gave me the confidence that I needed to aim high and shoot for the positions I didn\\'t see myself achieving for another 5 years. Thanks to his guidance, I landed a job two weeks before graduating as a DevOps engineer for an amazing company who works with what is in my opinion the best tech stack you can have in 2021. Compared to other bootcamps that say you don\\'t pay until you get hired (or worse, the ones that take a percentage of your salary!) Ironhack was the only clear viable choice for me. I knew full well going into it that I was there for Brito first and foremost and to make great connections second. I\\'ve created some relationships that I hope to carry with me for life not only with fellow students but with my teacher Niko as well. I can\\'t say enough about the teacher I had. Honestly I have never seen a teacher so passionate when it comes to his student\\'s success. Most teachers would traditionally stop and go MIA as soon as the clock turns over or your time in the bootcamp is up, but not at Ironhack. Niko and I actually started a passion project together which is aimed at helping students stay in touch and keep learning and connecting with others even post-graduation. I think that speaks for itself in the amount of care that goes into your learning experience. You\\'ll never feel like you\\'re just a number on a spreadsheet that needs to get a grade. If you are in the same situation I was four months ago meaning you are passionate about code, are self taught and have been struggling to enter the professional world or are simply afraid of the financial burden of having to take out a loan, take it from me. I went from earning 16k/year from self-employment income to now earning six figures doing the job I\\'ve been dreaming about ever since I was a teenager.

However, there are a few things I want an aspiring attendee to have in mind. First of all: - Ironhack advertises themselves as having a \\'90% placement rate 180 days after graduation\\'. This is very misleading. The placement rate is calculated by dividing the number of employed students / number of students looking for a job.

I recommend reading their number in details here https://www.ironhack.com/en/news/ironhack-student-outcomes-report-audited-by-pwc - Another point that might be implicit when applying for a 10 week bootcamp is that the education is quite shallow. We never learned how to make safe assumptions out of research data. Instead, we angled the research to fit our design idea. This was due to lack of time and lack of knowledge since we never actually learned why we did things on a deeper level. We never got any feedback on our actual design process or design thinking, only on how we presented our design. I think this is a problem since we compete with people with more education and more experience within research and design thinking. - The education was very unstructured which became really stressful. We were already expected to put in 60-70 hours a week, but the teachers rarely managed to keep the time, resulting in a huge stress since we every week had to deliver a product design and a great presentation. ...

Ironhack provided me with<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> more than enough guidance and resources to accomplish my goal of landing a job and making a complete career change. </span></p><p>This program is called a \\'bootcamp\\' for a reason. It is tough and intense. You are learning A LOT each day through lectures and (mostly) project work. However, the instructors are there for you at all times to answer any questions and offer you the proper guidance. The instructors I had were VERY knowledgable about the UX process and best practices, and they were always so patient with those who needed extra time to fully understand the concepts. I never felt intimidated or scared to approach them with any questions or concerns that I had. They created a very inspiring and encouraging classroom environment. Following the examples of our instructors, all of my fellow classmates were always willing to help each other out and pick each other up. By the end of the bootcamp, we had all gotten pretty close and it was honestly hard to say goodbye. </p><p>Another part of the program I really benefitted from was their Career Services. Brito (the Ironhack Outcomes Manager) is an absolute job and networking guru! Something I really liked about this part was their honesty. They made it clear that if you want to land a job out of this program, then you need to be the one doing the networking and applying. So many bootcamps out there promise that they will hand you a job right out of the program, which is total BS. But Ironhack\\'s approach is to teach you the best methods of networking, applying, interviewing, and setting up your LinkedIn. Rather than catching a fish for you, they teach you how to fish. </p><p>I was able to land a really good Product Design job within a month of graduating.

I really feel I still can\\'t make the most of them. - The webdev week is laughable. The \"lead teacher\" was trying his best to teach us webdev basics. I was expecting a proper webdev teacher with structured and organized classes. I thought my 8000€ would buy that. I was naive. - The social aspect is cheap. They emphasize on the possibility to network and all the fabulous events that are organized... It doesn\\'t exist. There are IronBeers on the rooftop once a week with one beer/person that they put in the fridge in advance so you can\\'t really come unexpectedly. For the last one we had a few chips, 1 slice of ham per person and madeleines from Franprix with cheap wine. Just sad and cheap. Now let\\'s talk about the pros: - the remote classes didn\\'t feel so remote. They had some training with the first lockdown. It was pretty easy to follow even though we weren\\'t on the campus. - The educational method is very efficient. You start working on projects from day one. You practice directly what you learn during class which makes it immediately very concrete and understandable. - At the end of the bootcamp, I felt ready to work. I had projects to show on my resume and I had some work worth a portfolio. And that is what counts!!!! - The career week and the coaching are both very good. I just finished so I can\\'t tell more but from I\\'ve seen so far, it\\'s the first time I feel supported in my job search. To wrap it up, like I said in the title: it\\'s a good bootcamp but you can probably find the same quality for less money.

       "  'I did the full time bootcamp. It was just before the second lockdown so I followed classes on the campus and on Zoom. I have mixed feelings about it so I made 2 lists. Let\\'s start with the cons (so I can finish on a positive note): - There is only 1 teacher.... Read More He\\'s called lead teacher but he is the only one so \"lead\" here is irrelevant. I think it\\'s a shame because there are so many ways to do design that learning just one approach is a bit short. - They make you buy a macbook for nothing. There are two 3 hour lessons on Sketch. Which is pretty much the only reason you\\'d need a Mac. keep your money, work on a PC and borrow a MacBook for these lessons. You\\'ll be fine. - Figma &amp; Sketch Labs are very very light. I really feel I still can\\'t make the most of them. - The webdev week is laughable. The \"lead teacher\" was trying his best to teach us webdev basics. I was expecting a proper webdev teacher with structured and organized classes. I thought my 8000€ would buy that. I was naive. - The social aspect is cheap. They emphasize on the possibility to network and all the fabulous events that are organized... It doesn\\'t exist. There are IronBeers on the rooftop once a week with one beer/person that they put in the fridge in advance so you can\\'t really come unexpectedly. For the last one we had a few chips, 1 slice of ham per person and madeleines from Franprix with cheap wine. Just sad and cheap. Now let\\'s talk about the pros: - the remote classes didn\\'t feel so remote. They had some training with the first lockdown. It was pretty easy to follow even though we weren\\'t on the campus. - The educational method is very efficient. You start working on projects from day one. You practice directly what you learn during class which makes it immediately very concrete and understandable. - At the end of the bootcamp, I felt ready to work. I had projects to show on my resume and I had some work worth a portfolio. And that is what counts!!!! - The career week and the coaching are both very good. I just finished so I can\\'t tell more but from I\\'ve seen so far, it\\'s the first time I feel supported in my job search. To wrap it up, like I said in the title: it\\'s a good bootcamp but you can probably find the same quality for less money. So if you have a grant or subsidy of any kind go for it!Read Less',\n",

For me, it was life-changing. I came into class with minimal background in design and walked... Read More out the door with a wide range of skillsets (from UX Research, Design Thinking, UI Design software technical skills to even project management and communication, etc.). The Ironhack Miami classroom environment is beautiful, and its location is a jewel (in the heart of Brickell).But the real value of Ironhack Miami resides in its people and staff. The social interactions, professional network, and friends that you are going to make there are gold. I cannot thank enough to my design instructors Snezana, Juno, and Jade. Big THANKS also to Brito, the Digital Talent &amp; Business Development Manager, for his constant support and advice after graduation in the Job Hunt process.All I can say is that a year ago, I was frustrated in a job with no growth, no passion, no recognition for my efforts, and today I am moving into a full-time UI Design role in a big company in the middle of a pandemic with a tough job market. Still cannot believe it, my life is about to change, and Ironhack was definitely the trigger.THANK YOU IRONHACK MIAMI SO MUCH!!!Personal advises:- If you can, create a little design foundation by learning before joining the course (Youtube, etc.). This will make you stand out- PLEASE never stop learning, during, and even after the course. Be curious and try to learn as much as you can by yourself. Just the course is not going to make you land the job or a pro.

Read More coding experience, but it does not hold your hand: you will get from it as much as you are willing to put in it. Expect long days of work, with some calmer ones and fun activities in between. The feeling of accomplishment you get when you see your own web apps online is just amazing. After the technical bootcamp there is a week they call careerhack where you will get some really good counseling on how to make the best out of your job search. Here too I found very good support materials and the coach was just excellent.I definitely recommend it, but clear your schedule for the next 10 weeks.

       "  \"Overall, I'm happy about my experience in Ironhack. To preface, I had zero technical background and graduated so if I can do it, you can too! That being said, some things to consider ---1. It is a lot of hard work normally, but especially if you don't... Read More have a strong technical background get ready to put in extra work/time/dedication before and after class and through your weekends. 2. After all that grinding, you are able to produce 3 awesome projects (which you will be very proud of). However, your overall grasp on web development is still pretty shallow so be prepared to continue learning and deepening your knowledge even after graduation. This bootcamp is a great starting point! And lastly, 3. Even though this class is remote and invites students from anywhere, it is still focused towards South Florida particularly during Career Week where they help you search for jobs and prep you for interviews. Although they do teach you how to search for jobs (with this skill it's applicable to wherever you are), but many of their references to jobs, companies, connections, speakers, fast track interviews matchmaking system, etc. are all Florida-based, so people who don't live there may feel excluded. The career department for all USA students is a one man show - Granted he is very knowledgeable and has much wisdom to offer, but I hope Ironhack hires more people to support in this area as the graduates' career needs are surely growing and beyond the limits of just one person.Overall, the experience was good, the instructors were GREAT, I cried, I laughed, I learned a lot, and it's worth the money.Read Less\",\n",

Super well structured combined with an easy going environment. I really relate with Ironhacks methodology of teaching, much based on putting our learning’s straightway in practice. Although there is an amazing campus right on the river side with an amazing atmosphere, I don't regret at all taking the online experience. I came to this bootcamp with low knowledge on Ux/Ui Design and in just two months I feel ready and confident to start practicing it professionally.Read Less\",\n",

If you devote a fair amount of time to learning, you are definitely job-ready after the bootcamp.Read Less\",\n",

Job support is good, they facilitate lots of connections and open data to connect you with potential employers, explain how to do CVs, cover letters, social networks, etc. If you've never did that, or not sure how to approach job hunting in IT, don't pass on their help here.Overall great stuff, Jan2020 cohort thanks for everything :)Read Less\",\n",

I was having doubts but the day I payed the bootcamp a visit they talk me about some financing options, so I took some days to do my budget and gave it a green light, I enrolled in the next FT bootcamp. <br>As I mentioned early, it was hard and challenging, if you have zero coding background (math is not that important) you better enroll in the part time bootcamp, if you had some coding subjects in school you just need to apply (a lot) yourself, if you know how to code but you want to learn fast and with help the bootcamp stack then it is a very good jump start for learning the language and the tools. Maybe you come from a different background that is not technology, if that is your case consider first the halftime bootcamp because it can get frustrating how little time you have and how many things you got to learn and how complex are the projects you have to deliver. <br>My lead teachers were very good, very young (considering the average of my career teachers) but they were awesome coders and dedicated about teaching , sometimes a little cocky; my teacher assistants were good maybe sometimes hard to find or not as crafty as one would like, they were always well intentioned even the times the fix they gave you crashed your code, but every bootcamp has different teachers and assistants so only fortune can tell who your teachers are going to be. One thing I can tell you, yes the program will include the most fitted technologies to go and search for a job and enough knowledge to get you started as an entry level programmer, depending on how easy if for you to build upon those skills is who much more you can achieve in your job search, the other skills that you learned before also add up to that. <br>In few words my bootcamp experience was very good,just remember, you need to be up to the task. <br>About my job quest and job support experience, I can tell you that my job support has been very good, very unique times (covid pandemic) to be looking for job, I notice that the technology market keeps growing and keeps hiring people at least more than the other markets,some of them <br> are shrinking or paused, so I cannot tell at this moment if the same rules of the year before apply to my future job and salary offers, but I\\'m glad the Tech and coding market is still hiring and growing. <br>It is a great and outstanding work and support the one being made by the \"hiring support team\" I can tell that it makes a difference in your favor to have them, ( I notice because I pass many months looking for job by myself before the bootcamp), so it is awesome to have them once you finish the bootcamp, It is not a walk in the park, it is still demanding looking for a job but the burden is less. </span></p><p>Is it worth it ? well, short answer YES, is not cheap ( try looking for a scholarship or financing help); the end is just the beginning, as you finish the bootcamp you notice that there are SO many different technologies, tools and languages out there that it gets a little overwhelming, so look into the things you like and apply yourself on learning those new things you want or need.<br>I have many thing to tell but I think these word are good enough to give you an idea of the experience. <br>Best of luck if you choose this path.</p><span class=\\'read-less-text\\' style=\\'display:none;\\'><a class=\\'read-less-button\\'>Read Less</a></span></span>',\n",

I have no restrictions in saying that Ironhack's UX/UI Bootcamp completely changed my life, and in all the very good senses.Não tenho nada além de coisas boas a dizer sobre o Bootcamp UX/UI da Ironhack. Foi simplesmente incrível, em todos os sentidos. Foi o que me permitiu mudar de carreira de uma maneira que eu nunca poderia ter esperado. A Ironhack me deu todos os suprimentos necessários para me tornar uma UX Designer, não apenas com um incrível conteúdo de estudo, uma tremenda professora e teacher assistants, mas também com apoio em geral, para me realocar como profissional.Fui presenteada com uma professora do mercado real que nos mostrou o quão importante é a empatia, e como isso deve ser incentivado desde o início. Tudo começou dentro da nossa sala de aula, com experiências e projetos que nos inspiraram a ter empatia não apenas com nossos usuários, mas conosco e entre nós, como colegas de classe (e mais tarde bons amigos).Conseguimos entrar em contato com todo o processo de Design Thinking e Double Diamond, e pudemos desembaraçar cada etapa das metodologias para entender quando devemos aplicá-la e como aplicá-la. Ainda temos apoio integral, mesmo após o curso, pois todos nos tornamos bons amigos de profissão e de vida.Além disso, mesmo em tempos difíceis, sempre há empresas entrando em contato comigo, e posso notar como meu currículo é atraente agora, e sei que devo isso a essa experiência que tive. Não tenho restrições em dizer que o Bootcamp UX/UI da Ironhack mudou completamente a minha vida e, em todos os bons sentidos.Read Less\",\n",

Big hats-off to how quickly and smoothly the school moved online as a reaction to the Covid-19 situation. During the transition, they kept us informed and made sure that our concerns are heard and handled accordingly. The communication, readiness and agility was truly remarkable.During the course we had meetups with various professionals from the industry coming over to share their experience and expertise. This was very inspiring and helpful from the point of networking. The course helped me refresh and broaden my skills to match the today's industry adopted workflows and concepts. I feel confident to attend job interviews and I am ready to share my experience as a UX/UI Designer with colleagues and contribute to a team.Read Less\",\n",

I applied to this course very early (8 months before I started) which allowed me to thoroughly study the topics beforehand. However, it was only during the course that I really got the grasp of everything I know right now on Python, Pandas, Web Scrapping, SQL, Statistics in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, etc. This is not all though, we had numerous talks about topics concerning data analysis such as Business Intelligence, Object Oriented Programming, Mongo DB, Django and many more. It would be an endless list if I continued mentioning all the skills I have acquired. This really opened my job opportunities despite the current crisis with COVID109. In fact, I believe this was the right moment in my life to dive into tech as the job market is now changing and becoming more conscious of the importance of digitization. I recommend Ironhack to anyone who is studying Programming on their own and/or wants to change their career towards tech. I have tried multiple courses online before this but nothing can compare. This is will be hard work, so be conscious of that. For 2 months you will be studying and working on projects nonstop. At the same time you will have great and supportive staff and colleagues who will be there for you not only to help you out but to share a laugh with. My advice is for you to take a good look at the syllabus and review beforehand the topics you think you may struggle with. Personally, for me, was Statistics (I come from a humanities educational background) and I needed more time with on this than some of my colleagues. During the bootcamp it will be hard for you to keep reviewing the same topic because you are constantly learning new things. Prioritize your time as best as you can! Overall, great experience.

Truth be told, that\\'s exactly what happens. <br>The curriculum is very well structured, teaching you the fundamentals and problem solving skills before diving into more code specific details. You learn the most up-to-date technologies and practices.

       "  'I feel obligated to write a review for this course because I have very mixed feelings about the experience. I will try to be as honest as possible. Before the course starts, students must complete prework assignments based off an online learning platform.... Read More The platform was a good start but didn’t always provide all necessary information or enough examples to completely understand the material. The TAs are available to help, but in my experience they didn’t always get back to me right away (I later learned why—the TAs are extremely overworked). The prework needs improving because there’s no good way to accurately see if you’ve learned enough before the course starts, even by completing the two assignments. As for the course itself: class was from 9-18:00 but if you’re taking it seriously, you’ll stay several extra hours to complete the lab assignments. It’s lots of self-learning. The website is accurate in its structure of the day, with lectures and labs interspersed. They’re good at giving you lots of breaks, which you’ll need. The TAs are amazing and work hard to help you, sometimes sitting down for long periods of time to debug your code. Personally I think they did more than the teacher and deserve more pay/credit. On the other hand, the fact that TAs can help you whenever and assignments are often done with partners, it’s hard to know if you truly understand the material. You might be completing assignments after receiving help from others, so it’s hard to gauge whether you’ve comprehended it all. Personally I felt like my TAs coded my entire project because I didn’t understand any of it, while the feedback from the TAs was very positive. I therefore felt there was a huge discrepancy because they couldn’t truly see how people were doing. When I tried to advocate for myself, they always just told me I was fine. The projects overall are a great way to break into a new career. You’ll learn a lot and add to your portfolio. Additionally, you’ll do 1/2 daily labs, mini projects, so you’ll build up a good foundation. After the bootcamp I think learning online would be impossible. IH barely scratches the surface, and to learn the same amount without a bootcamp would take years, especially without help from peers. On the other hand, I personally think IH isn’t the right bootcamp anymore. Perhaps it once was, but its career services leave something to be desired (in the case of my class: a career). Our hiring week took place right before Christmas, so it might as well not have happened, as no one hires then anyway. After that, we received only a couple emails within the three months after graduating, not nearly enough compared to the services promised. They also weren’t overly available for meetings so scheduling usually wasn’t instantaneous, and my meetings were short and seemingly unproductive. They told me things I already know. More frustrating is the fact that of all the people in my class looking for a new job, only a small number got hired within those three months, probably well below a 50% hiring rate, or even 30%. Overall, a bootcamp may or may not be a good decision, but for the financial and physical and mental health costs, IH is not the best choice.Read Less',\n",

I truly recommend Ironhack if you don\\'t know how to code and want to jump to the tech world, it can be \"expensive\" but it\\'s worth every dollar.

Daniel Brito who is in charge of career services, does an excellent job helping students providing essential information and tips to land jobs. When I came to this country without any degree (only my HS diploma) I thought I would not find a real good job, but after Ironhack that changed.Read Less',\n",

It's important to know this bootcamp is just the beginning of a lifelong journey of learning, do NOT expect to leave her knowing everything you will need to be a master developer. IF YOU PUT IN THE WORK, it WILL give you a great base to build from, a portfolio to show off to potential employers, a fantastic team of people who will be in your corner to help you succeed, and a group of friends that become almost like family.Read Less\",\n",

Unfortunately the TA I started the program with only<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> held the position for a couple of weeks and then this spot was filled by a number of temporary replacements. This didn’t allow me to get very close to any of those people and it felt like a resource that I expected to have wasn’t really available that cohort. In the end, we turned to fellow classmates for supplemental help most of all and this teamwork really helped many of us. The course is very intense and incoming students should expect to be stressed out by the workload. A lot of information is packed into a few months, so it’s important to bookmark all of the important websites your teacher shows you and of course to take good notes! If you have past work experience that relates at all to the duties of a UX/UI designer or even if you just had a strong interest in parts of the process, this will come in handy! I’d always had an interest in art and had done some graphic design before. On the other hand, if you have zero relevant experience and were interested in completing this course, I would say to be patient and realistic about where your skills might be by graduation time. While I do think Ironhack can give you a boost and help you get started with your new career, I saw some classmates struggle with creating professional-looking visual designs- even by the end of the course. So if you’re doing something difficult for the first time, don’t expect a miracle. That said… coding week was not great for me. Most of the other students had had at least a little bit of exposure to coding before the course, so they were able to keep up with the instructor. A few students (including me) had never had any exposure and we fell behind and could never catch up. I was repeatedly told that it was ok if I knew nothing about coding, but it felt like a little more understanding was necessary to understand the fast-talking teacher I had for coding week. Daniel Brito was my career coach while I was there and I really appreciated his support. He gave me a lot of awesome advice and helped me see things from the perspective of the employer. Although he was busy assisting lots of students, he did a good job of dividing up his time and giving me his full attention when it was my turn. In the end, I walked away with a portfolio that helped me get my current job, so it was worth it for me! Plus it’s nice to be part of the Ironhack network.</span></p><span class=\\'read-less-text\\' style=\\'display:none;\\'><a class=\\'read-less-button\\'>Read Less</a></span></span>',\n",

This didn’t allow me to get very close to any of those people and it felt like a resource that I expected to have wasn’t really available that cohort. In the end, we turned to fellow classmates for supplemental help most of all and this teamwork really helped many of us. The course is very intense and incoming students should expect to be stressed out by the workload. A lot of information is packed into a few months, so it’s important to bookmark all of the important websites your teacher shows you and of course to take good notes! If you have past work experience that relates at all to the duties of a UX/UI designer or even if you just had a strong interest in parts of the process, this will come in handy! I’d always had an interest in art and had done some graphic design before. On the other hand, if you have zero relevant experience and were interested in completing this course, I would say to be patient and realistic about where your skills might be by graduation time. While I do think Ironhack can give you a boost and help you get started with your new career, I saw some classmates struggle with creating professional-looking visual designs- even by the end of the course.  So if you’re doing something difficult for the first time, don’t expect a miracle. That said… coding week was not great for me. Most of the other students had had at least a little bit of exposure to coding before the course, so they were able to keep up with the instructor. A few students (including me) had never had any exposure and we fell behind and could never catch up. I was repeatedly told that it was ok if I knew nothing about coding, but it felt like a little more understanding was necessary to understand the fast-talking teacher I had for coding week. Daniel Brito was my career coach while I was there and I really appreciated his support. He gave me a lot of awesome advice and helped me see things from the perspective of the employer. Although he was busy assisting lots of students, he did a good job of dividing up his time and giving me his full attention when it was my turn. In the end, I walked away with a portfolio that helped me get my current job, so it was worth it for me! Plus it’s nice to be part of the Ironhack network.',\n",

You possibly have done your research and read all this \"Is it worth it to go through coding bootcamp\" kind... Read More of articles. As a recent graduate of Ironhack full-time web development course I\\'m here to tell you to do it. It is totally worth it and will affect your life in a positive way. There is one thing that all this unsure or negative bootcamp reviews have in common - they all are by software engineers and developers. Think about it. The person attended the top bootcamp - and then he/she is a developer. Full stop. If you putt in the effort, put in the hours and do what they tell you to do, learn what they offer you to learn then this will be your story. Whatever background you come from - it is doable to step into the fascinating world of technology. I know it because I\\'m telling my own story.  I went through full stack web dev course and learned MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, HTML, CSS and the list goes on and on. But most important I\\'ve learned that I can do it. I\\'ve learned how to think and how to approach the technical challenge that I\\'m facing. I got the whole lot of new connections, relevant to the field as well.The IronHack Miami staff is all you can ask for. Nobody here looks at titles and everybody are here to help in any way they can.

I learned the tools ready for the job market and I feel more than confident with my skills to learn, implement, and practice any project that a company or... Read More business requires. The staff in Ironhack Mexico was beyond excellent, I was surprised with the continued support that everyone in the staff provided. I do recommend to anyone that wants to attend this camp has some previous learning in order to get a better experience. Do the prework that they require but also go beyond and try to learn more programming. If you expect going into the bootcamp without having any interest in programming you may discover that programming is not for you, but this won't be the bootcamps fault rather than yours. Ironhack offers great tools for the job market, a great career work support, and an amazing staff that will become your family. In truth, they do their best to prepare you but most of it falls on you.Read Less\",\n",

The campus is very nice - they provide food/coffe and all the necessities in dedicating 9 hours of your day 5 days a week there. The entire staff is very helpful and friendly. They also host networking/social events for students and people within the industry.The ciririculum was on point as well - broken into three sections you learn everything including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express, React, and various JavaScript libraries as well. They base the cirriculum on the current demands of companies who are hiring developers. Everything taught is relevant and practical.Where Ironhack excels the most is the most important part of joining an extensive program - job assistance. Daniel Brito is responsible for assisting students in the job hunt after graduation, and he goes above and beyond in doing so. In my first week he held one on ones with every student and he mentioned that if you do everything that he tells you then you will be successful in finding a job. He lived up to that promise as i was able to find a job within 2 weeks of our hiring fair. He is extremely well connected when it comes to the tech space in south florida. Our hiring fair had many reputable companies who were actively hiring. He continues to communicate and help once the hiring fair is complete. All in all - i had a fantastic experience at Ironhack, and if you are looking to be employed shortly after an extensive program, i highly recommend it.Read Less',\n",

       "  '<span class=\"truncatable\"><p>I was a full-time student for the Full-Stack Web Development Cohort that graduated Dec 18, 2018. I had an AMAZING experience with Ironhack Miami. To give you an idea of how the class is structured, Week 1 and 2: FRONTEND: learn JS, HTML, CSS, jQuery,<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> DOM Manipulation, Canvas. Week 3: Use those skills to create a game application, present at end of the week. Week 4 and 5: BACKEND: learn Node.js and Express, amongst numerous other topics. Week 6: Use those skills to create a full-stack application, present at the end of the week. Week 7: Learn React.js. Week 8 and 9: Create a Full-Stack MERN application, present at the end of Week 9. All non-project weeks are pretty much structured the same: Topic 1 lecture in the morning, then a paired lab. Topic 2 lecture in the afternoon, then a solo lab. The class was structured to have one lead instructor and 2 TAs. While this might sound similar to other bootcamps you\\'ve researched, I would like to point out the \"stand outs\" that make Ironhack Miami unique, which are the reasons why I ultimately chose it instead of other bootcamps I looked at:</span></p><p>1. Career Services: I can pretty much guarantee you will not find another bootcamp with a Career Services Manager like Daniel Brito. Not only is he incredibly well connected and great at creating partnerships with the school and local companies, but he is SO resourceful and involved. He typically lectured once a week to the class for an hour, and once you graduate the meetings get more frequent and more specialized to each student and their current job situation. I\\'ve been a working professional for 10 years and Brito still had great LinkedIn, Resume and Career advise to offer that I had never heard. While Brito is not the ONLY benefit to joining Ironhack, he is the most impactful benefit, hands down.</p><p>2. Pre-Work: This was the second most beneficial part of Ironhack for me. Other bootcamps I looked at did not require pre-work, but this was by far the difference that made me not completely lost when I started school. While the pre-work was VERY hard for me, as I was a career changer and not used to the terminology, the technologies or anything, the pre-work was SO helpful because it . forced me to familiarize myself with all of this BEFORE class started. If there had no been . pre-work, I don\\'t think I would have been nearly as successful in the class as I was.</p><p>3. Building.co: this is the building Ironhack is located in. Some great features to note about it that were super helpful being a student- 24 hour access to the building, via secured access, unlimited free granola bars, unlimited free coffee (of ANY type), unlimited beer on draft starting at 5 PM, cool kitchen/outdoor space with picnic tables and corn hole to relax and take breaks. Building.co is a co-working space so there are a lot of tech people who have desks there to work, which is ideal for networking as a tech student. </p><p>4. Guest speakers: tech speakers were brought in typically once every 2 weeks to talk to the class. This was helpful for networking purposes, but also for insight into the industry, what people do, what they are looking for, etc.</p><p>5. Lisa - the Growth Manger, was always great about hosting industry events at Building.co and in the area for students to attend with Miami tech industry people. This, again, was great for networking and more exposure to the industry.</p><p>6. The curriculum was well thought out and offers a lot of resources for you to have outside of class. If you pay attention in class, then go back and read all of the lectures, you will get the most benefits. Now that I am out of school and interviewing, I realize how many of the interview questions/vocab were in our lesson plans, I just never read them during class. READ THE LECTURES!!! They are super helpful!!</p><p>7. Lastly, the overall atmosphere created by the Ironhack Team is truly incredible. It is such a family/friend atmosphere where you work super hard, pull intense all nighters, but there is a sense of \"we are in this together\" and \"we are here for you\" which makes the whole process more fun and enjoyable.</p><span class=\\'read-less-text\\' style=\\'display:none;\\'><a class=\\'read-less-button\\'>Read Less</a></span></span>',\n",

It\\'s a full time 9-5pm every day for 9 weeks (not including the after hours you want to put in as well) it\\'s no joke so just prepare to fully invest the next 9 weeks into IronHack. You learn for 2 weeks and then immediately are sent off to create a project within a week - repeat again 2 more times after that. Come in prepared to learn, take in all the material, and be willing to put in the work.</p><p>Help During Course Work / Curriculum (TA’s and Teacher)</p><p>The instructor for our Cohort (Nick) was very knowledgeable. The only downside was that it was his first time teaching the course, so it felt like he was also learning as we were all trying to learn something too. Besides that, he was most definitely a great instructor and without his proficiency on the subject, I would not have learned as much as I did.

It was extremely helpful having dedicated TA\\'s who were former students helping us because they know the struggle so they WANT to help. There\\'s more than enough help to go around, just make sure to ASK for it when you need it and you won\\'t fall behind.</p><p>The coursework definitely needed some tweaking on some days, our instructor Nick pushed aside what he felt was wrong and obsolete and taught it the best way he could and it definitely worked out. During the course this was one of my top issues, the curriculum for sure needed an update, but from what I have seen after my time there they are (or already have) taken the steps necessary to do so. Which means they take your feedback seriously and won\\'t brush your input aside.</p><p>Rest of Ironhack Staff</p><p>Since the first day I applied and even now the staff at Ironhack hasn’t missed a beat. They have been helpful and there for me with any questions I had. They have an idea as to what they want to do with the course, and they definitely make sure that you receive the best experience possible. It doesn’t matter who you try to contact, the owner, down to the TA’s, they all respond happily and make you feel like one of them.</p><p>Hiring Fair Prep</p><p>From the first week at Ironhack, you become well acquainted with a man named Brito. Take his advice seriously if your goal is getting a job. He walks you through all the necessary steps to prepare you, such as building your resume, creating your LinkedIn, and lets you know about networking events to attend. He constantly brings in people to give speeches to you weekly. Brito is a great source for help and information so make sure you are constantly checking in with him. Along with all this prep work, you are also creating your portfolio during the course. You create 3 projects (on your own or in a small group) which showcase everything you\\'ve learned in the course from beginning to end and is the first step to the building of your portfolio.</p><p>Hiring Fair Event</p><p>At the end of the course, Brito arranges companies to come to Ironhack and sit down with you for interviews. This is a valuable introduction for your first interviews. Eventually, you will be off doing interviews on your own and this hiring fair is a great way to evaluate what you did and didn\\'t do so that ultimately you become more and more comfortable during them. Still, that doesn\\'t mean you shouldn\\'t take these interviews at the hiring fair seriously, definitely come prepared to nail them during the event - people DO get hired out of these. This is what you prepare for, and it helps to prepare for future interviews.</p><p>Post Ironhack Experience</p><p>After Ironhack, finding a job (if that is what you are there for) is the next battle. Brito is there with you every step of the way. He holds placements help meetings at Ironhack every other week and is always available for any questions you have. He guides you and reminds you that you must KEEP CODING and KEEP APPLYING. If you slack off on those two steps, the job hunt instantly becomes much harder. Take your LinkedIn, networking, and resume seriously. Do little projects on your own after the cohort, and make sure your JavaScript knowledge is fresh by doing coding challenges on HackerRank/Codewars because they will help with the technical interviews.</p><p>I did not get hired immediately after Ironhack. I applied to around 300+ jobs and only got about two handfuls of phone interviews and in-person interviews. I got hired 3 and a half months after. I never stopped coding, I never stopped applying and I always kept in touch with Brito. This process in itself could feel more stressful than the boot camp, but do not quit.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Yes - you learn a lot at Ironhack and are given great guidance, but no they will not hand you a job. You get everything you need from them and now it’s up to you to put in the work and land it. They are there with you every step of the way. I would 100% do it again, I put my life on hold, invested in myself, pushed through and changed my career into something I felt would be more fulfilling. So far it hasn’t disappointed one bit. Not only do you learn a lot at Ironhack, but you make tons of friends and become part of their great community.</p><p>If you have any questions feel free to message me on LinkedIn and I will gladly answer them for you</p><span class=\\'read-less-text\\' style=\\'display:none;\\'><a class=\\'read-less-button\\'>Read Less</a></span></span>',\n",

       "  \"About MeI worked in IT, and did some coding, but nothing past basic JavaScript. It peaked my interest, so I began learning on my own by taking courses online. I realized I needed to go about learning in a different way. I researched courses/boot camps... Read More and ran into Ironhack and decided to dive in and take it’s Full-Time Web Dev course after coming across great reviews/ratings.Expectations and Course Run DownBe ready to learn, because you’re going to learn a lot. It's a full time 9-5pm every day for 9 weeks (not including the after hours you want to put in as well) it's no joke so just prepare to fully invest the next 9 weeks into IronHack. You learn for 2 weeks and then immediately are sent off to create a project within a week - repeat again 2 more times after that. Come in prepared to learn, take in all the material, and be willing to put in the work.Help During Course Work / Curriculum (TA’s and Teacher)The instructor for our Cohort (Nick) was very knowledgeable. The only downside was that it was his first time teaching the course, so it felt like he was also learning as we were all trying to learn something too. Besides that, he was most definitely a great instructor and without his proficiency on the subject, I would not have learned as much as I did. As for the teaching assistants, all three of them were amazing (Sandra, Marcos, Ian). They were all very familiar with the coursework since they were all Ironhack graduates as well. It was extremely helpful having dedicated TA's who were former students helping us because they know the struggle so they WANT to help. There's more than enough help to go around, just make sure to ASK for it when you need it and you won't fall behind.The coursework definitely needed some tweaking on some days, our instructor Nick pushed aside what he felt was wrong and obsolete and taught it the best way he could and it definitely worked out. During the course this was one of my top issues, the curriculum for sure needed an update, but from what I have seen after my time there they are (or already have) taken the steps necessary to do so. Which means they take your feedback seriously and won't brush your input aside.Rest of Ironhack StaffSince the first day I applied and even now the staff at Ironhack hasn’t missed a beat. They have been helpful and there for me with any questions I had. They have an idea as to what they want to do with the course, and they definitely make sure that you receive the best experience possible. It doesn’t matter who you try to contact, the owner, down to the TA’s, they all respond happily and make you feel like one of them.Hiring Fair PrepFrom the first week at Ironhack, you become well acquainted with a man named Brito. Take his advice seriously if your goal is getting a job. He walks you through all the necessary steps to prepare you, such as building your resume, creating your LinkedIn, and lets you know about networking events to attend. He constantly brings in people to give speeches to you weekly. Brito is a great source for help and information so make sure you are constantly checking in with him. Along with all this prep work, you are also creating your portfolio during the course. You create 3 projects (on your own or in a small group) which showcase everything you've learned in the course from beginning to end and is the first step to the building of your portfolio.Hiring Fair EventAt the end of the course, Brito arranges companies to come to Ironhack and sit down with you for interviews. This is a valuable introduction for your first interviews. Eventually, you will be off doing interviews on your own and this hiring fair is a great way to evaluate what you did and didn't do so that ultimately you become more and more comfortable during them. Still, that doesn't mean you shouldn't take these interviews at the hiring fair seriously, definitely come prepared to nail them during the event - people DO get hired out of these. This is what you prepare for, and it helps to prepare for future interviews.Post Ironhack ExperienceAfter Ironhack, finding a job (if that is what you are there for) is the next battle. Brito is there with you every step of the way. He holds placements help meetings at Ironhack every other week and is always available for any questions you have. He guides you and reminds you that you must KEEP CODING and KEEP APPLYING. If you slack off on those two steps, the job hunt instantly becomes much harder. Take your LinkedIn, networking, and resume seriously. Do little projects on your own after the cohort, and make sure your JavaScript knowledge is fresh by doing coding challenges on HackerRank/Codewars because they will help with the technical interviews.I did not get hired immediately after Ironhack. I applied to around 300+ jobs and only got about two handfuls of phone interviews and in-person interviews. I got hired 3 and a half months after. I never stopped coding, I never stopped applying and I always kept in touch with Brito. This process in itself could feel more stressful than the boot camp, but do not quit.ConclusionYes - you learn a lot at Ironhack and are given great guidance, but no they will not hand you a job. You get everything you need from them and now it’s up to you to put in the work and land it. They are there with you every step of the way. I would 100% do it again, I put my life on hold, invested in myself, pushed through and changed my career into something I felt would be more fulfilling. So far it hasn’t disappointed one bit. Not only do you learn a lot at Ironhack, but you make tons of friends and become part of their great community.If you have any questions feel free to message me on LinkedIn and I will gladly answer them for youRead Less\",\n",

It was well beyond what I expected from a web development course, and I found these lessons particularly rewarding.

For this I enrolled in some basic PHP / Javascript courses with MySQL Database and an additional Oracle Database 12c course. But they were just that: basic courses. They gave me an aerial view of what Web development is in these times but they did not go deep enough to feel safe to go after a job in the development area.<br>And as in social networks there is nothing hidden (we know how the algorithms that make product suggestions work, learning our tastes and posting notices of topics that we have touched or visited previously) I saw in one of these networks, an advertising of a Full Stack Web training that caught my attention because of its content. It was not a simple computer course like other ones in the market. It was really a formal study where in two and a half months a good part of the tools, frameworks, methodologies, etc., would be covered for the development of Web applications. It described how we are going to go, from the basics to making applications that from a user\\'s point of view were as complex as making calls to API\\'s RestFUL of spatial geolocation to create technology trending Web applications. A walk through HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, JSON, NodeJS, Express, Ajax, Axios, Angular all this with MongoDB Database, alternating with continuous development tools such as GIT and project planning as Trello. I found it a challenge and as I said initially, an investment for my return to the area that brought me so much satisfaction. Of course, I did an exhaustive search of trainings of this type in Madrid to make a comparative table and I finally decided on Ironhack because it seemed to me the most complete of all the training I saw, in addition to the fact that I am very learning in person, to be near the instructor and surrounded by people who could ask for help to clarify doubts if that were the case. For this reason, I proceeded to write via email to the contact person that appeared in the promotion. The answer was immediate and I started the procedures to be able to register for the FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOT CAMP - FULL TIME JUNE 2018 training. Here the journey began.</p><p>Important to clarify that I did not have the money to do this training but here is another advantage that immediately allowed me to strengthen my decision. At Ironhack, they have two financial support institutions that could finance the training with the necessary flexibility to cover the costs. What more could I ask for!</p><p>Now, I went through a series of questions and qualification interviews to validate if I had the capacity to do this training and that they did not represent a problem for me to enter since I had the advantage of having studied Computer Engineering 25 years ago and something was left of the programmatic thinking. I went immediately to the Pre-Work, a series of exercises and activities to soak students with certain basic knowledge and thus start from the first day to learn everything necessary to carry these two and a half months of intensive training. And that\\'s what it is, that\\'s why the denomination of \"Boot Camp\". Let\\'s understand the concept. Here you come to work. And work hard. Every day, from Monday to Friday and including several weekends, is hard work. Beginning with the fact that two exercises (or projects) are done daily. One in the form of pair-programming, which gives us the notion of what it is to work with a team, and the other project you work individually. And some of these exercises tend to be extensive which makes it difficult to finish without staying up late (my personal recommendation for those who register: do not get up late, seek to do what possible but put a limit on working hours because fatigue accumulates day after day and every day you will see important matter that requires attention and all the senses in it). And every two weeks there will be a large project (three in total) where you can practice what you have learned in the previous weeks. For this reason, if you feel that some of the concepts were not well learned, calm that in each project will have the opportunity to resume and apply these concepts.</p><p>It is true that many concepts are seen, but the learning methodology, being able to use continuous development tools such as GIT, working as a team in various exercises or projects, is basically what you face in real work environments. And for that they prepare you.</p><p>Another important point to note is the support and ongoing advice on human resources issues, where you will have sessions to improve your Linkedin profile (or create it for those who have not registered) and your résumé. As an anecdote, just changing some things in my profile, I got the first day two contacts of people looking for Web developers from England. These consultancies are worth their weight in gold and should be used as much as they are part of the Ironhack program that seeks to position their students in the labour market. And believe me, its work.</p><p>Finally, after two months and a week of continuous learning, Ironhack organizes a week called the \"hiring week\" where they invite a group of companies that will be validating your projects and interviewing students for possible work places to be filled with Boot Camp students. It is time to show your talents and you have a high chance of getting a job related to the topics seen. Particularly I had already gotten a job before this week so I did not attend and yet you have saved the opportunity to attend some future process if you wish.</p><p>Finally, it must be understood that Ironhack, besides being a learning academy, is also a community. A community where events are constantly being published where you can review trends, new technologies or simply have an invitation to spend a Friday evening with friends with some beers. As a member of this community you can call to give a talk to new students about your experience, how to handle the stress of the activities, or simply accompany a new student under the figure of \"buddy\" in order to listen and advise how to carry The Boot Camp to these new members.</p><p>Ironhack has been an experience, an investment that has paid off and allowed me to reinsert myself into the technical world, something that fills me with satisfaction. It was a total good experience in which a made a good friends and contacts in a web partners that for sure, is going to be maintained for years.</p><p>Jesús Martínez<br>www.linkedin.com/in/jesus-martinez-alvarez</p><span class=\\'read-less-text\\' style=\\'display:none;\\'><a class=\\'read-less-button\\'>Read Less</a></span></span>',\n",

One in the form of pair-programming, which gives us the notion of what it is to work with a team, and the other project you work individually. And some of these exercises tend to be extensive which makes it difficult to finish without staying up late (my personal recommendation for those who register: do not get up late, seek to do what possible but put a limit on working hours because fatigue accumulates day after day and every day you will see important matter that requires attention and all the senses in it).

Read More pieces or enclaves in a society. In my particular case, immigrant and with more than 17 years previous working in the commercial area in Sales of Technology, having made the decision to invest in the training of Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp in Ironhack has meant a turning point in my career. And for me it has been precisely that: an investment in the future.When I decided that I wanted to return to the roots of my studies (I\\'m an Computer Engineer) after so many years without writing a line of code, concerned only about selling products that in some cases I did not understand what they do, I started a search for a study system that I could obtain the necessary knowledge to go in search of a job in what many years ago was my livelihood and why not, my satisfaction. For this I enrolled in some basic PHP / Javascript courses with MySQL Database and an additional Oracle Database 12c course. But they were just that: basic courses. They gave me an aerial view of what Web development is in these times but they did not go deep enough to feel safe to go after a job in the development area.And as in social networks there is nothing hidden (we know how the algorithms that make product suggestions work, learning our tastes and posting notices of topics that we have touched or visited previously) I saw in one of these networks, an advertising of a Full Stack Web training that caught my attention because of its content. It was not a simple computer course like other ones in the market. It was really a formal study where in two and a half months a good part of the tools, frameworks, methodologies, etc., would be covered for the development of Web applications. It described how we are going to go, from the basics to making applications that from a user\\'s point of view were as complex as making calls to API\\'s RestFUL of spatial geolocation to create technology trending Web applications. A walk through HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, JSON, NodeJS, Express, Ajax, Axios, Angular all this with MongoDB Database, alternating with continuous development tools such as GIT and project planning as Trello. I found it a challenge and as I said initially, an investment for my return to the area that brought me so much satisfaction. Of course, I did an exhaustive search of trainings of this type in Madrid to make a comparative table and I finally decided on Ironhack because it seemed to me the most complete of all the training I saw, in addition to the fact that I am very learning in person, to be near the instructor and surrounded by people who could ask for help to clarify doubts if that were the case. For this reason, I proceeded to write via email to the contact person that appeared in the promotion. The answer was immediate and I started the procedures to be able to register for the FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOT CAMP - FULL TIME JUNE 2018 training. Here the journey began.Important to clarify that I did not have the money to do this training but here is another advantage that immediately allowed me to strengthen my decision.

       "  '<span class=\"truncatable\"><p>In this review, I aim to provide an honest account of my experiences as a student in Ironhack’s April - June 2018 cohort in Miami, FL. I chose to wait until after I had been out of the course and in a job for a while before reflecting on my experience<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> and evaluating how well Ironhack prepared me for what I am currently doing.<br> <br>My Ironhack Experience:<br> <br>Application:<br> I did a great deal of research within a small period of time before applying, going through the interview process and leaving my previous employer to join Ironhack. Like many other students, I decided on Ironhack because of the curriculum, the reputation of Brito as an Outcomes Manager, and the reputation of their lead instructor Nizar, however, when the cohort started I learned that we would have a new instructor, Nick, an Ironhack graduate. When I registered for this course many of my classmates and I was under the impression that Nizar would be our teacher who I understood was someone with years of real world experience and was the primary reason for all the great reviews about Ironhack.<br>I decided about three weeks before the cohort started to join in April which was just enough time before it was too late. The coding challenges and pre-work used the same online portal which contained their learning modules. Once I got the learning material I had to get them done within the one week I had before the cohort started so I worked that week on the online material full time to get ready for the first week. I cannot stress how important it is for you to really focus on the pre-work and understand the meaning behind what it is that you are going to be learning and do further research when necessary. If at any point you find yourself questioning whether or not this is for you, take time away from the problems you are having and come back to it with a fresh perspective. This is a habit you should try to incorporate in your learning as you are working with abstract concepts you haven’t been exposed to yet or are re-learning. It\\'s really easy to get frustrated when you are first starting out which causes some students to drop out of the cohort before it really has time to start.<br> <br>Curriculum / Lectures / Projects:<br> The first week is spent developing a browser game which when I initially signed up sounded like a lot of fun, and at times it was, however, I do not feel that it fits the curriculum when considering how much better the time could be spent. I would recommend spending more time to focus on the fundamentals, working collaboratively (git-flow), and more time on coding challenges/interview prep.<br> Many of the examples within the modules when learning these new concepts were essentially the same which made it harder to grasp some of the concepts we were going over. A large portion of information, direction, and dependencies for the labs and lectures were out of date or not set up properly. Some learning modules were skipped altogether and a lot of time was wasted on bugs that can be avoided if the lecture notes and labs were updated or reviewed by the instructor before the lecture for the day began. I was also having a hard time grasping these concepts when I was encouraged to just copy paste what was in the modules to do my labs and my projects instead of thinking it though.<br> There was a sudden change the day before the final project weeks started where our cohort was preparing to put together their individual projects for our personal portfolios and then it was announced that we would be working in groups for the last project. We were not told from the beginning that we were to take into consideration that we would be working on the final project in pairs or groups of three. We were never taught best practices dealing with version control and how to go about working with multiple people on a project at the same time. The brief overview that we had on collaborative git practices lasted less than 30 minutes and didn\\'t even cover how to deal with merge conflicts or common errors that would come up in collaborative scenarios.<br> Our instructor Nick was gone during the second to last week which was one of the most important weeks of our cohort. The majority of people in the course have been stuck on the same issue which dealt with having a login session persist across views in Angular. The only example we have to go off of was incomplete because of all of the bugs we ran into the week before Nick left and the TA’s were not able to figure out how to resolve the issue. If the Ironhack staff knew that he was going to be out during this important week that should have arranged for a substitute or have prepared the TAs to take over the curriculum for the week. The TAs would only be able to help to a certain extent until they are unsure of how to proceed due to their lack of experience and we\\'re left to wait in line to be assisted by Nick, however that week we did not have the option so there was a great deal of lost time. My group members and I should not have been feeling the need to pay by the minute on tutoring websites like Hackhands and to make up for the lack of education we had received to get our project done in time.<br> <br>Learning Environment:<br> I can’t speak for other cohorts, but the April 2018 cohort was fantastic. Everyone got along really well and we all still keep in touch with one another regularly post-graduation. Building.co is a fantastic workspace. Free beer, coffee, fruit, snacks, and there are plenty of good options for eating in the area. My only criticism is that Building.co can get a bit cramped at times as far as private areas for studying and meetings go, but that’s expected considering it’s a co-working space. The TAs were incredibly helpful throughout the cohort. Shoutout to Sandra for always staying far later than she needed to help us with our projects throughout the cohort. I’m sure I speak for all of my classmates when I say that we wouldn’t have been able to achieve what we did without the support of the TAs. Brito also brought in some great guest speakers and organized a panel of alumni to come to talk to us about their post-graduate experiences.<br> <br>Career Week:<br> Career Week is the most important week you will at Ironhack. The content during this week is crucial to your job search and should be followed to the letter if you plan on getting hired and will be applicable beyond entry-level job searches. If you haven’t heard of or really considered Career Week as a selling point for your investment in an experience at Ironhack I would highly encourage you to reconsider and look at some of the companies that Ironhack is partnered with and the companies that graduates like myself are currently working at.<br>Career week is a fantastic opportunity where companies come to Ironhack in order to interview graduates in a \"speed dating” fashion. You get to meet with many companies, and if you are inexperienced with interviewing like I was at the time, it may help you to get over the nervousness of being in an interview. If you\\'ve read any of the other reviews on this site or other sites about Ironhack Miami I\\'m sure that you have read or heard the name Daniel Brito or Brito for short. Brito is the Outcomes Manager, and it is his responsibility to work towards partnerships with companies and bring them in to meet potential graduates as candidates for entry-level jobs. He’s one of the most connected people in the Miami tech scene and has your best interests in mind. Ironhack would not be the same without his efforts. He was one of the most supportive people throughout the entire cohort and has continued to help me after graduation and reach out to me to see how my new job is going. <br> <br>Post-Graduation / Job Search:<br> I received my job offer from CareCloud, one of the companies that came to our hiring fair, about a month and a half after the cohort ended. However, do not place all your bets on getting a job from one of the companies that come to career week, this would be a huge mistake. Brito will be there every step of your job search from interview to offer letter as long as you follow the guidelines and strategies that he goes into detail about throughout the week. Never stop coding during your search, it’s important to keep your committing to new projects and continuing your learning so that you have something to show employers what you’ve been doing with your time since graduation. If you lose your motivation to teach yourself after the cohort is over you’re going to have a very hard time finding a good job.<br> <br>Overall, I would recommend Ironhack to someone looking to make a career change, however, I would also like to see many things improved as it continues to grow. I felt that my cohort was disorganized and that there was a serious lack of curriculum preparation. I did not see efforts made to improve the quality of our experience throughout the cohort\\'s duration although we were giving them feedback every few weeks. I was not satisfied with how my education at Ironhack turned out at the time of graduation. I went through career week and then graduated lacking the confidence in my skill set necessary to get through a real technical interview. The weeks following graduation I spent all my time working on projects and learning React which I knew would help me stand out more when looking for a job while reinforcing JavaScript fundamentals and applying to jobs using Brito\\'s advice.<br> <br>I am currently writing up an accompanying article for this review that I hope will fill in any other gaps for those who are looking into or graduating from Ironhack and boot camps like it which will include helpful resources that I used before, during and after my boot camp experience that helped me get my new job at CareCloud.<br> <br>Feel free to add me on LinkedIn or shoot me a message on the Ironhack Slack channel with any questions or comments that you may have.<br> <br>Best,<br>Ryan Martin</span></p><span class=\\'read-less-text\\' style=\\'display:none;\\'><a class=\\'read-less-button\\'>Read Less</a></span></span>',\n",

Once I got the learning material I had to get them done within the one week I had before the cohort started so I worked that week on the online material full time to get ready for the first week. I cannot stress how important it is for you to really focus on the pre-work and understand the meaning behind what it is that you are going to be learning and do further research when necessary. If at any point you find yourself questioning whether or not this is for you, take time away from the problems you are having and come back to it with a fresh perspective. This is a habit you should try to incorporate in your learning as you are working with abstract concepts you haven’t been exposed to yet or are re-learning. It\\'s really easy to get frustrated when you are first starting out which causes some students to drop out of the cohort before it really has time to start.\\r\\n \\r\\nCurriculum / Lectures / Projects:\\r\\n    The first week is spent developing a browser game which when I initially signed up sounded like a lot of fun, and at times it was, however, I do not feel that it fits the curriculum when considering how much better the time could be spent. I would recommend spending more time to focus on the fundamentals, working collaboratively (git-flow), and more time on coding challenges/interview prep.\\r\\n    Many of the examples within the modules when learning these new concepts were essentially the same which made it harder to grasp some of the concepts we were going over. A large portion of information, direction, and dependencies for the labs and lectures were out of date or not set up properly. Some learning modules were skipped altogether and a lot of time was wasted on bugs that can be avoided if the lecture notes and labs were updated or reviewed by the instructor before the lecture for the day began. I was also having a hard time grasping these concepts when I was encouraged to just copy paste what was in the modules to do my labs and my projects instead of thinking it though.\\r\\n    There was a sudden change the day before the final project weeks started where our cohort was preparing to put together their individual projects for our personal portfolios and then it was announced that we would be working in groups for the last project. We were not told from the beginning that we were to take into consideration that we would be working on the final project in pairs or groups of three. We were never taught best practices dealing with version control and how to go about working with multiple people on a project at the same time. The brief overview that we had on collaborative git practices lasted less than 30 minutes and didn\\'t even cover how to deal with merge conflicts or common errors that would come up in collaborative scenarios.\\r\\n    Our instructor Nick was gone during the second to last week which was one of the most important weeks of our cohort. The majority of people in the course have been stuck on the same issue which dealt with having a login session persist across views in Angular. The only example we have to go off of was incomplete because of all of the bugs we ran into the week before Nick left and the TA’s were not able to figure out how to resolve the issue. If the Ironhack staff knew that he was going to be out during this important week that should have arranged for a substitute or have prepared the TAs to take over the curriculum for the week. The TAs would only be able to help to a certain extent until they are unsure of how to proceed due to their lack of experience and we\\'re left to wait in line to be assisted by Nick, however that week we did not have the option so there was a great deal of lost time. My group members and I should not have been feeling the need to pay by the minute on tutoring websites like Hackhands and to make up for the lack of education we had received to get our project done in time.\\r\\n \\r\\nLearning Environment:\\r\\n    I can’t speak for other cohorts, but the April 2018 cohort was fantastic. Everyone got along really well and we all still keep in touch with one another regularly post-graduation. Building.co is a fantastic workspace. Free beer, coffee, fruit, snacks, and there are plenty of good options for eating in the area. My only criticism is that Building.co can get a bit cramped at times as far as private areas for studying and meetings go, but that’s expected considering it’s a co-working space.  The TAs were incredibly helpful throughout the cohort. Shoutout to Sandra for always staying far later than she needed to help us with our projects throughout the cohort. I’m sure I speak for all of my classmates when I say that we wouldn’t have been able to achieve what we did without the support of the TAs. Brito also brought in some great guest speakers and organized a panel of alumni to come to talk to us about their post-graduate experiences.\\r\\n \\r\\nCareer Week:\\r\\n    Career Week is the most important week you will at Ironhack. The content during this week is crucial to your job search and should be followed to the letter if you plan on getting hired and will be applicable beyond entry-level job searches. If you haven’t heard of or really considered Career Week as a selling point for your investment in an experience at Ironhack I would highly encourage you to reconsider and look at some of the companies that Ironhack is partnered with and the companies that graduates like myself are currently working at.\\r\\nCareer week is a fantastic opportunity where companies come to Ironhack in order to interview graduates in a \"speed dating” fashion. You get to meet with many companies, and if you are inexperienced with interviewing like I was at the time, it may help you to get over the nervousness of being in an interview. If you\\'ve read any of the other reviews on this site or other sites about Ironhack Miami I\\'m sure that you have read or heard the name Daniel Brito or Brito for short. Brito is the Outcomes Manager, and it is his responsibility to work towards partnerships with companies and bring them in to meet potential graduates as candidates for entry-level jobs. He’s one of the most connected people in the Miami tech scene and has your best interests in mind. Ironhack would not be the same without his efforts. He was one of the most supportive people throughout the entire cohort and has continued to help me after graduation and reach out to me to see how my new job is going. \\r\\n \\r\\nPost-Graduation / Job Search:\\r\\n    I received my job offer from CareCloud, one of the companies that came to our hiring fair, about a month and a half after the cohort ended. However, do not place all your bets on getting a job from one of the companies that come to career week, this would be a huge mistake. Brito will be there every step of your job search from interview to offer letter as long as you follow the guidelines and strategies that he goes into detail about throughout the week. Never stop coding during your search, it’s important to keep your committing to new projects and continuing your learning so that you have something to show employers what you’ve been doing with your time since graduation. If you lose your motivation to teach yourself after the cohort is over you’re going to have a very hard time finding a good job.\\r\\n \\r\\nOverall, I would recommend Ironhack to someone looking to make a career change, however, I would also like to see many things improved as it continues to grow. I felt that my cohort was disorganized and that there was a serious lack of curriculum preparation. I did not see efforts made to improve the quality of our experience throughout the cohort\\'s duration although we were giving them feedback every few weeks. I was not satisfied with how my education at Ironhack turned out at the time of graduation. I went through career week and then graduated lacking the confidence in my skill set necessary to get through a real technical interview. The weeks following graduation I spent all my time working on projects and learning React which I knew would help me stand out more when looking for a job while reinforcing JavaScript fundamentals and applying to jobs using Brito\\'s advice.\\r\\n \\r\\nI am currently writing up an accompanying article for this review that I hope will fill in any other gaps for those who are looking into or graduating from Ironhack and boot camps like it which will include helpful resources that I used before, during and after my boot camp experience that helped me get my new job at CareCloud.\\r\\n \\r\\nFeel free to add me on LinkedIn or shoot me a message on the Ironhack Slack channel with any questions or comments that you may have.\\r\\n \\r\\nBest,\\r\\nRyan Martin',\n",

       "  'In this review, I aim to provide an honest account of my experiences as a student in Ironhack’s April - June 2018 cohort in Miami, FL. I chose to wait until after I had been out of the course and in a job for a while before reflecting on my experience... Read More and evaluating how well Ironhack prepared me for what I am currently doing. My Ironhack Experience: Application: I did a great deal of research within a small period of time before applying, going through the interview process and leaving my previous employer to join Ironhack. Like many other students, I decided on Ironhack because of the curriculum, the reputation of Brito as an Outcomes Manager, and the reputation of their lead instructor Nizar, however, when the cohort started I learned that we would have a new instructor, Nick, an Ironhack graduate. When I registered for this course many of my classmates and I was under the impression that Nizar would be our teacher who I understood was someone with years of real world experience and was the primary reason for all the great reviews about Ironhack.I decided about three weeks before the cohort started to join in April which was just enough time before it was too late.

The course covers a wide range of topics and gives you all the tools needed to start your career as a junior developer,<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> however to get the best out of the course, it’s important to be fully invested and to know what outcomes you want from your bootcamp.</span></p><p>- the negatives –<br>There is a big importance on team building within the class and with the other cohorts happening at the same time, but at times this can feel a bit forced. If you’re not very social, this can be tiring.</p><p>Scheduling/organization seems to be a bit of an issue. Some examples: having (somewhat required) career prep sessions or activities during our lunch breaks, never receiving reinforcement lessons, catching up on courses during our project weeks, etc. This probably depends a lot of the cohort and the other factors, but some things just seemed last second and/or badly timed.</p><p>+ the positives +<br>The materials are good, and the staff is nice, but the stand out was our instructor, Nizar. He is truly an excellent teacher; enthusiastic and very clear in his manner of explaining (simple and complex) concepts. I could not have asked for a better instructor for the course.</p><p>The career services were also super helpful. The Outcomes Manager, Dina, helped us with our resumes, rebranding, and explaining our background to recruiters. We got to meet with many companies, as well as recruitment sites. I most certainly feel that without the connections of Ironhack, I would not have had as much exposure to companies looking for junior developers.</p><p>Three weeks after the bootcamp, I had three offers from very interesting companies.

Needless to say, the bootcamp experience is really not for the weak hearted. It pushes you beyond your limits and tests you on every level to really pull out the best within each student.</span></p><p>The most important skill I’ve learned during my time at Ironhack was to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. That’s essentially the nature of the course; it forces each student to enhance their strengths, but most importantly, work on their weaknesses. There is limited time to get assignments done, so exercising better time management is essential. There are presentations and public speaking almost every week, there is the constant exercise of accepting failure and making mistakes, and the idea that perfection is your enemy (so if there are any perfectionists out there, get ready to let go of this habit guys, because everything is actually supposed to be “Agile”). I also learned that throughout any UX/UI design process, the user should always be the guide, and you really have to follow and respect the process, never jump to solutions. </p><p>The staff at Ironhack was very helpful and most importantly, were always positive. It really helps to be surrounded by instructors and TA’s who believe in each student’s potential, who are ready to listen when you need to vent, who provide constructive feedback, any help needed or just be uplifting with optimistic comments. I am very grateful to everyone at Ironhack who guided me throughout the cohort: my teacher, David, my TA’s Hugo and Hector, my Web Dev week instructors Sandra and Colby, as well as Brito, our super dedicated Career Resources professional! They just made my time in the cohort extremely enjoyable and meaningful.</p><p>Also, being in such an amazing co-working environment such as Building, helped make the experience memorable. I really love it there, I always feel welcome and comfortable, like it is my home away from home. I have spent A LOT of time there, and I love the fact that students have access to the space 24/7 with the use of the fob (I didn’t want to return mine at the end of the cohort!). It is no wonder I would always tell people who asked me about the course that I would live at Building and sleep in Aventura. I cannot express enough how much I loooooved being in that space and am happy to return each time I visit. Everything about it was awesome: the classroom environment with the ability to write and ideate on the white walls, cover the glass walls with our sticky notes, the nook with the comfy couch on the 2nd floor, cafecito at 3:05 brought to us everyday by the very sweet ladies: Mercedes and Maria, and especially the rooftop with the beer on tap. It is just a great space to get inspired, work, and also to network.</p><p>The only cons I have for the cohort, is that I wish the course were longer. I personally think 3 months would be ideal, but if not, then at least 2 weeks extra so that the students can have more time to work with the web devs and also to better prepare for the hiring week. I felt an enormous amount of pressure to get my portfolio ready and honestly didn’t feel comfortable with what I presented to perspective employers. So it is important to have either an extra week to solely focus on that or to incorporate it more throughout the cohort (weekly check-ins on the progress, time for business cards to be made). It was constantly drilled into us that “the portfolio is what will get you hired”, so quality time to work on it is essential. Students will be better prepared and most likely result in more hires right out of the hiring fair. So, win win on both ends: great for the students as well as the school. Being able to work more closely with the web dev cohort is also essential in order to better prepare for the field. It would be great to work with them in fully developing one of our projects into a functional app, for example.</p><p>Overall, my experience at Ironhack was very positive and this was the best investment I have done for my career. I had to overcome a lot of personal difficulties and blockers along the road, but truthfully, there is nothing more fulfilling than when you overcome something that initially might seem impossible, whether that is fear of public speaking or just delivering assignments on time. I loved every minute of the cohort and will forever be a proud Ironhacker. I have made incredible friends, developed a great support system with the school, and am excited as well as ready for what is yet to come!!!

Needless to say, the bootcamp experience is really not for the weak hearted. It pushes you beyond your limits and tests you on every level to really pull out the best within each student.The most important skill I’ve learned during my time at Ironhack was to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. That’s essentially the nature of the course; it forces each student to enhance their strengths, but most importantly, work on their weaknesses. There is limited time to get assignments done, so exercising better time management is essential. There are presentations and public speaking almost every week, there is the constant exercise of accepting failure and making mistakes, and the idea that perfection is your enemy (so if there are any perfectionists out there, get ready to let go of this habit guys, because everything is actually supposed to be “Agile”). I also learned that throughout any UX/UI design process, the user should always be the guide, and you really have to follow and respect the process, never jump to solutions. The staff at Ironhack was very helpful and most importantly, were always positive. It really helps to be surrounded by instructors and TA’s who believe in each student’s potential, who are ready to listen when you need to vent, who provide constructive feedback, any help needed or just be uplifting with optimistic comments. I am very grateful to everyone at Ironhack who guided me throughout the cohort: my teacher, David, my TA’s Hugo and Hector, my Web Dev week instructors Sandra and Colby, as well as Brito, our super dedicated Career Resources professional! They just made my time in the cohort extremely enjoyable and meaningful.Also, being in such an amazing co-working environment such as Building, helped make the experience memorable. I really love it there, I always feel welcome and comfortable, like it is my home away from home. I have spent A LOT of time there, and I love the fact that students have access to the space 24/7 with the use of the fob (I didn’t want to return mine at the end of the cohort!). It is no wonder I would always tell people who asked me about the course that I would live at Building and sleep in Aventura. I cannot express enough how much I loooooved being in that space and am happy to return each time I visit. Everything about it was awesome: the classroom environment with the ability to write and ideate on the white walls, cover the glass walls with our sticky notes, the nook with the comfy couch on the 2nd floor, cafecito at 3:05 brought to us everyday by the very sweet ladies: Mercedes and Maria, and especially the rooftop with the beer on tap. It is just a great space to get inspired, work, and also to network.The only cons I have for the cohort, is that I wish the course were longer. I personally think 3 months would be ideal, but if not, then at least 2 weeks extra so that the students can have more time to work with the web devs and also to better prepare for the hiring week. I felt an enormous amount of pressure to get my portfolio ready and honestly didn’t feel comfortable with what I presented to perspective employers. So it is important to have either an extra week to solely focus on that or to incorporate it more throughout the cohort (weekly check-ins on the progress, time for business cards to be made). It was constantly drilled into us that “the portfolio is what will get you hired”, so quality time to work on it is essential. Students will be better prepared and most likely result in more hires right out of the hiring fair. So, win win on both ends: great for the students as well as the school. Being able to work more closely with the web dev cohort is also essential in order to better prepare for the field. It would be great to work with them in fully developing one of our projects into a functional app, for example.Overall, my experience at Ironhack was very positive and this was the best investment I have done for my career. I had to overcome a lot of personal difficulties and blockers along the road, but truthfully, there is nothing more fulfilling than when you overcome something that initially might seem impossible, whether that is fear of public speaking or just delivering assignments on time. I loved every minute of the cohort and will forever be a proud Ironhacker. I have made incredible friends, developed a great support system with the school, and am excited as well as ready for what is yet to come!!! Cheers!!!Read Less',\n",

Besides design, this Bootcamp teaches you how to be successful in your life, solve problems and never give up. It\\'s all about passion...its all about GRIT. The teaching staff has been great and they were often available to help you also in extra hours. Many thanx to our instructor David and 2 TA\\'s: Hector and Hugo. All of them were supporting and pushing you to do more and learn more. The curriculum is amazing too and focused on your practical skills. Like we say in Ironhack \"Learning by doing\".

       "  \"I attended the Web Development bootcamp at Ironhack in Barcelona about two years ago. When I attended, I had been working as a web designer for 3 years and I was looking to extend my skills and maybe go for a career change. I though I wanted to do web... Read More development, but I wasn't sure yet. Everything I knew at that point was self taught, so I figured I needed some serious study in order to feel more confident. After three months of intense studying during the bootcamp, I must say that I managed to build a web app and I had the guts to apply for a front end position. After some trial and error, I finally got the job I wanted :)The pros of the bootcamp are that it's really accessible, that there were people there to support us even at 9 - 10pm, that the final project we worked for was really practical and mentored by people working in the field and that at the end we had great opportunities for interviews.I really liked that the levels of people in the cohort really varied so while some fellow students could help me with certain issues, I could, in my own turn, help other with different issues. This way, you never feel too bad about yourself. We also worked really hard, till late in the night sometimes, and the tutors were there to help. They were really nice, supportive and dedicated. For the final project, based the profile of the project, we got matched with someone working in the field. At the end, looking at what I had built, I felt proud and confident that I could take that app further. The tutors also helped us optimise our linked in profiles, we had professional photos taken and really felt that they did everything to help us find a job that we like.For me, the biggest benefit was that I figured out what I liked from web development (specifically Front End development) and that I gained confidence to apply for the job I wanted.The cons are that, indeed, being very accessible, you get people with very different backgrounds and for some it can be very difficult. I had some knowledge of how the web works, of HTML and CSS, but for who doesn't have any knowledge, I think it can be pretty frustrating to dive straight into web development with all its aspects. Also, Back End and Front End are a lot to cover in 3 months, so I would actually prefer it if they were separate. Then you'd have more time to practice everything properly. Sometimes it felt rushed, because we had a curriculum to go through. That's about it. All in all, it's really helpful if you wanna taste the web development world and you're not sure which way to go. It also helps to fill in the gaps, if you have some knowledge already, but in bits and pieces, like I did. Good luck!Read Less\",\n",

But not only with your companions, all the IronHack Staff is always willing to help you, teachers, TA’s, etc. <br>Thats when you realized you have entered this little big family called IronHack.<br>And of course is Happiness too because when you finish, you look back and see how much you have changed, without knowing it in most of the cases, in just 9 weeks.</p><p>To finish, people ask me hot to define IronHack, and after thinking about it I just can say one thing: Ironhack is a life changing experience.</p><span class=\\'read-less-text\\' style=\\'display:none;\\'><a class=\\'read-less-button\\'>Read Less</a></span></span>',\n",

       "  'Hi! My name is Beltran, I’m 27 years old and I have no programing experience before IronHack.Now, why did I decided to leave everything and start the Web Development bootcamp here in Ironhack? There’s no easy answer to that question so let me put a little... Read More bit of background before trying to explain myself.I started working in Hospitality at the same time I was studying my psychology grade in the university. I always though that this little jobs I was doing were just temporal jobs until I became a Staff member in one restaurant. That was the moment I realized that I didn’t wanted this as my professional career, so I started looking something more related to what I really like, and there is when I found Iron Hack.So i decided to leave everything and start a new adventure in IronHack. And I have to say that I don’t regret at all my decision. My experience in IronHack can be summarized in just a few words: “Fear, surprise, work and ‘Sadpiness’”.Fear? Why Fear?When you decide to make such a change, to get out of your confort zone, to try something new its absolutely normal to feel fear. Fear of change, fear of the future, etc. This fear disappears in the first days of class because you meet a lot of people that have made that change too.Don’t let the fear make your choices.Surprise.That’s what I felt when I started learning “difficult” things that I never heard of before, and I liked them. And talking about them, using them, and even helping others with problems you already faced makes you think “I never though I could learn those things”.Work.I’m not going to lie to you, I spent more or less 12-14 hours a day working there. I entered at 9:00 in the morning at I left between 21:00 and 23:00. Its hard? Yes it is, but its worth the effort. And when you really realized how much time has passed your are finishing your last project on your own, thinking about how fast the bootcamp has passed.Sadpiness.Sadpi… what?Its a new word I have invented because I don’t know how to express the feeling you have when you finish the bootcamp. Its Sad because all the people you met, you suffer with, you laugh and sometimes cried. All that people that helped you and you helped during this fantastic journey, are going to take their paths. The bond you make with them is strong enough to keep the contact and take a beer once a week (or twice). But not only with your companions, all the IronHack Staff is always willing to help you, teachers, TA’s, etc. Thats when you realized you have entered this little big family called IronHack.And of course is Happiness too because when you finish, you look back and see how much you have changed, without knowing it in most of the cases, in just 9 weeks.To finish, people ask me hot to define IronHack, and after thinking about it I just can say one thing: Ironhack is a life changing experience.Read Less',\n",

The previous instructor, Nizar, moved from Miami to Paris, and was replaced with Louis. Louis lacked Nizar's experience, and became less professional as the cohort went on, being less prepared for more advanced material and often leaving mid-day, letting the TAs (Jess and Sandra, who were both fantastic) manage the class. Louis isn't coming back - he decided to go to Japan after finishing the cohort - and I'm not sure who his replacement is. If you're interested in the camp, that's the first thing I'd ask about.The curriculum is largely solid, but has a few intermittent bugs and grammar issues. Honestly, though, I'd rank it above my college experience in terms of usefulness and structure, as well as any class I've seen on places like Udemy. It's intelligently structured, and gives you the information required to learn the skills necessary to complete exercises and build projects. They're also actively working on fixing issues in the curriculum right now, and it's a safe assumption that you will have a cleaner experience with the material than I did.I think the quality of the job assistance matters more than the quality of instruction in a bootcamp - realistically you could teach yourself everything here with a few Udemy courses, a solid work ethic, and maybe some contacts in the coding community or online - but it's hard to leverage that into a job. Job assistance is where Ironhack shines. Their job placements manager, Daniel Brito, is constantly working phones and email to get respected developers in the community to give presentations and companies looking for talent to come to hiring fairs. He has tons of resources to teach you how to manage your job hunt, and is pretty much constantly available for questions on Slack (or in emergencies, his phone). This effort is reflected in the experience - if you do as he says, you'll develop contacts in the Miami tech community, which will lead to job offers. It's also worth noting the location is incredible. The building is right next to a train stop in downtown Miami as well as a decent parking garage, and is blocks away from dozens of fantastic restaurants. The building itself is also amazing - it's a well-appointed coworking place with free snacks, coffee, and beer on tap. It was scary signing up for Ironhack, but I honestly think it was the smartest decisions I've ever made in my entire life. I learned an employable skill in less than three months, got to make dozens of friends with other like-minded and driven people, and leveraged the experience into a new job. Expect to work hard - the 400 hour estimate they give you is low, and the most successful students were those that showed up a few hours early and left a few hours later - but if you do, it'll change your life.One more thing - if you decide to sign up for Ironhack, take a cohort date a few months from now, and spend some time learning the material. Colt Steele's Web Development bootcamp and Advanced Web Development bootcamps on Udemy are a fantastic primer for the large majority of the class, and completing at least the first course beforehand will give you a huge leg-up on learning skills well and making solid, presentable projects, which will help you significantly when job hunting.Read Less\",\n",

Read More have any design or IT background; I come from the world of retail operations so I was scared of being in disadvantage comparing myself to other people who were coming from a design background. In reality, you have nothing to worry about; the good think of having people that come from a design background is that you can get inspired by them and know what other tools and skills are out there so you can continue learning when you finish the bootcamp. I have now completed my course and I am very happy for the decision I made. I've spent 9 weeks with people that are now like family. We were supporting and motivating each each other, which makes you grow even faster. They were the most intense 9 week of my life as I was exposed to a vast amount of new information, new tools (sketch, invision, marvel, flinto,..) and daily deliverables.

Learning from Andre, our main teacher, was an incredibly valuable experience. He is not at all comparable to any other teacher I met in the course of my academic journey. He is inspiring, incredibly skilled and knowledgeable in all realms of the industry. The same applies to the great technical assistants. Everyone is really eager to help you and motivate you throughout the course. <br>I don’t want to sugarcoat anything, the curriculum is intense and your personal outcome also depends a lot on yourself and how much effort you put in. Be consistent and don’t stress out when you don’t get a concept right a way. You will get there with sufficient practice. As Andre taught us, they give us the shoes; we are the ones to put them on. Apart from the curriculum, you will have the chance to educate yourself in related fields. Almost everyday there are events, lectures and workshops that you can attend. </p><p>BARCELONA OPEN SPACE<br>When it comes to the right location for you to attend a bootcamp, Barcelona is definitely the place to be; the city is vibrant, young and is known for its growing tech scene. I recommend you to make use of all the great facilities that the Ironhack office provides. You’ll have the possibility to be at Ironhack 24/7. The open space with all its facilities offers you the perfect place to unfold your potential and really immerse into the world of programming. There is also a flat upstairs with a nice rooftop to study and have a barbecue with your IH friends to unwind after hours of learning and coding. The staff really trusts you guys and gives you all the freedom you need to feel as comfortable as possible. They are all really attentive to your needs and are very perceptive to any feedback. In general, the staff is always friendly and always approachable with whatever question you have.</p><p>JOB PERSPECTIVES<br>Regarding job perspectives, it is a bit too soon to be opinionated since it’s two days since the bootcamp is over. However, if it helps you to get an idea, everyone from the previous cohort landed a developer job before our cohort ended. The placement manager as well as the rest of the team are really supportive and provide help with your portfolio. Also, the hiring week at the end of the bootcamp will help you to get in touch with different tech companies in Barcelona. </p><p>PREPARATION<br>I’d like to make a short remark for those of you who have no prior knowledge. Although the program does not require any prior preparation besides the pre-work, I strongly recommend you to prepare yourself upfront using free online resources with main focus on JavaScript. It will keep your frustration level lower in case you are starting from scratch. However, don’t feel intimidated by this, it is not required and you can go along without any pre-knowledge.</p><p>IRONHACK FAM<br>Last but not least, I would like to address a very special thing about the program. When applying for Ironhack, I mainly focused on the learning experience itself and haven’t thought so much about the positive factors that this course brings along. But believe me, it’s the piiiiipool that make this experience so unforgettable! Although you might think that 2 1/2 months are a pretty short time to build close relationships, the bootcamp will prove you wrong!! You will have an amazing time with amazing likeminded people and will grow close together as a group. The group dynamics were unbelievable. We did a lot of different activities where everybody was included from day 1. We had legendary Friday nights, did rooftop BBQs, ping pong tournaments, samba nights, skiing trips and so much more). The Ironhack quarter really becomes your first home, the people your family and coding the nexus between both! </p><p>If you are really thinking of pursuing a career change, don’t hesitate anymore and join the Ironhack fam.

Personalmente, es la mejor decisión<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> que he tomado y estoy super orgulloso de haberlo hecho.</span></p><p>Para los que quieran una review con mas información intentaré hacer hincapié en los puntos fuertes de este Bootcamp:</p><p>1- El temario: No solamente te enseñan a \"programar\" desde 0 sino que te preparan para ser autosuficiente una vez acabado el bootcamp. Me explico:<br> En Ironhack aprendes MEAN Stack (Mongo, Express,Stack Angular, Node) + HTML5 &amp; CSS. Y esos conceptos aún con el poco tiempo con el que disponemos, arraigan en tu cerebro como si llevaras meses estudiándolos. Yo tenía un poco de Background en temas de CSS y HTML y en la primera semana ya estaba aprendiendo cosas nuevas que no sabía.<br>Una vez acabado el Bootcamp puede estudiar cualquier tecnología de manera autosuficiente. Esa seguridad que te da el aprender cosas nuevas y saber que puedes hacerlo, no tiene precio.</p><p>2- El equipo: Teacher &amp; Ta\\'s.<br>- Decir impresionante, me quedaría corto, por lo que voy a decir únicamente que somos unos afortunados por tener a estos profesionales enseñándonos todos los días. André es una bestia en lo que a conceptos y manera de enseñar se refiere, personalmente es una persona muy cercana y se puede hablar con él de cualquier cosa. Sabe transmitir los conceptos de una manera sencilla y fácil de entender, y creedme, en este mundo no es nada fácil. Los TA\\'s (teacher assistant) están ahí en cada momento en el que necesitamos ayuda y nos quedamos atascados en algún ejercicio y/o proyecto. </p><p>3. La familia Ironhack.<br>- Desde el primer momento nos sentimos cómo en casa, nos dijeron que pasaríamos más horas ahí que en nuestra propia casa (no me lo creí al principio, pero... si, es cierto). Y es que al final, preferías quedarte aquí con tus amigos trabajando que irte a casa a hacerlo solo.</p><p>El staff que está con nosotros es impresionante, desde el primer día te cuidan para que estés a gusto. Nunca han tenido una mala palabra, ni un gesto raro, ni una mirada especial. Estoy encantado de haberl@s conocido a tod@s, no sería lo mismo si no estuvieran aquí.</p><p>Las instalaciones son perfectas para el tipo de \"trabajo\" que estamos desarrollando aquí. Si tuviera que hacer mi propio Ironhack lo haría de la misma forma que lo hacen ellos, cada centímetro está pensado a la perfección para que los que estamos estudiando aquí como los que trabajan estén a gusto.</p><p>Finalmente y una de las cosas que me llevo y recordaré toda mi vida; los compañeros. Desde el principio congeniamos muy bien, la mayoría de nosotros estamos aquí para dar un cambio a nuestra vida laboral y en su efecto a nuestra vida en general. Tenemos muchas cosas en común y somos muy parecidos en la manera de ser (algunos más y otros menos) pero con el equilibrio que en todo sitio se necesita. Hacemos actividades conjuntas casi cada día (no es obligatorio!), desde Cervezas cada Viernes(y su fiesta posterior) hasta BBQ los fines de semana, Scape Rooms y visitas por la ciudad.</p><p>Finalmente, si has llegado hasta aquí es porque lo estás pensando muy seriamente, no lo dudes.

The pace of the lessons rarely gave us time to catch our breath, and the daily exercises (both individual, and in pairs) would often test our limits. On a couple of evenings, I found myself with my head buried between my hands in a moment of panic, telling myself “I can’t do this, I wasn’t ready for something like this”, and I wasn’t the only one. If I’m painting a bleak picture so far, don’t worry- I’ve resorted to the “bad news, good news” mechanic to save the best for later. Although intensive, the bootcamp (divided in three ‘modules’ of three weeks each, with a final project at the end of each one) helped me understand the basics of code in a very comprehensive way, starting with basic exercises and steadily increasing the number of iterations or the challenge they offered. The bootcamp covers many areas that are key for a developer including Javascript basics and advanced features, layouts and design, database management and package management to expand the possibilities of our frameworks- and yes, all of that sounds like a lot at first glance, but again, even a complete newbie like me managed to successfully complete the bootcamp.Now, my classmates and I are getting ready for the hiring week. For some of them, this will be a ‘level up’ in their career; for others, this is the start of a new one, and although I still have much to learn, I feel prepared to walk into web development with my head up high. And in addition to this, my final project -a website for musicians to find one another and start new bands and projects- became more than just a task to deliver at the end, and I have decided to continue working on it. Who knows, I might be releasing my very own website, made on my own and from scratch, in not too long!Read Less',\n",

Trust me if I say that the whole Ironhack bootcamp has been one the highest ranking experiences of my life. Let me explain you why.</p><p>Coding is hard. Learning to code in 2 months is very demanding<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> and does seem totally impossible. Believe it or not, the Ironhack campus in BCN is designed at every level (from the location, the building itself, the staff, the teachers, the syllabus, the events and the job opportunities) just to make that happen. It doesn\\'t get more ideal than that. Let\\'s address these points one by one.</span></p><p>Location: Barcelona is one of the most international cities in Europe. You do breath modernity and opportunity here, especially in the Poplenou neighboroud where the campus is located. It has become a kind of tech district, so on the way to class you pass by real tech companies and it gives you a feel of where you might end up working. Feels like you\\'re there already.</p><p>The campus: Fantastic open space with glass walls (Kanban boards drawn on them), plants hanging from the ceiling, kitchen, showers, desks, standing desks and tons of architectonic eye candies. It\\'s like your mind expands in there, and you\\'re hooked. You don\\'t want to leave. In fact you don\\'t. You\\'re given the keys and take advantage of the 24/7 access policy. You\\'ll need it on project weeks!!</p><p>The staff: They\\'re doing a fantastic job at keeping the place so well organized YET very informal, frienly and welcoming. I felt like I could express myself without having to fit in to any particular mould, and that was very valuable to me, because during the bootcamp you are reinventing yourself and pushing your brain hard on coursework in order to do that. So nobody will judge you if you spend hours by a standing desk coding and dancing looking more like a dj (or a crazy person) than a developer. You\\'re tired? You can take a nap in plain sight. Wanna play? Let\\'s skate or play football, inside of course. Nobody will ask you to stop. The staff is committed in having you become a web developer. They know kicking a ball will help your unconcious brain solve the kata.</p><p>The teachers: Andre has been one of the most inspiring and influential professional I ever met. The guy has more than 20 years of experience, and he knows how to deliver it to you. His technical knowledge is so intimate that I\\'m sure he natively thinks in Javascript then compiles in English for the rest of us. But it\\'s not just that he tought us a programming language (and to love it), he focused a lot on best practices and the workflow and mindset you have to adopt in order to transform your ideas in to products through coding, and having fun in the process. Then, he passed on us so many insights drawing form his own experience, filtering out for us the most valuable. Maybe not obvious at first, but Andre insights sit on the brain and release value as time passes by. And also, it must be said: he let us appreciate how cool a fully fledged web dev can be. </p><p>The teaching assistants: Ironhack employs the most suited students as teaching assistants for next cohorts. They\\'re three, with different levels of experience depending on how many cohorts they survived. Yes, because it\\'s not easy to stay patient having to debug horrible code by current students still not having a clue!! What you get from them is the closeness of relating with somebody who just finished the bootcamp, as well as accurate code revisions and debugging, directly from somebody who still remembers on what silly thing you\\'re more likely to get stuck on. They were stuck there too just a couple of months before, they know how and where to help.</p><p>The sillabus: Javascript is on fire nowadays and Ironhack is one of the few bootcamps to base its entire curriculum on it. Backend, frontend, all JS, because this is the present and the foreseable future of web dev. In fact, anything different would have felt like time wasting. The course is divided in three modules, each module giving you the teaching first and then challenging you on a project. The course material is constantly updated, you get exercises on a git repo to work on all night if you want. You\\'ll get a detailed revision of your code in the morning. In the first module you learn the basics, HTML, CSS and JS, and make a late 90s style JQuerish app with it. Addictive brain gymnastics. Then you\\'re introduced to Node.js in the second module, but server side. Mongo DB, Mongoose, Express. And you make a \\'00 style server rendered MVC app, which almost feels like a real thing. In the third module you\\'re thought a Javascript framework (this time it was Angular 5), and are given two weeks to complete your own full stack project. At some point while doing it, which happens at different stages for different people, it\\'s guaranteed that you will see the light. Like in the Karate Kid movie you\\'ll see how all they made you do click together. Your fingers begin flying on the keyboard, translating your thoughts in to code as if it was the most natural thing in the world, while you wonder what the hell is happening. That\\'s when a web dev has finally emerged from within you. </p><p>Events and job opportunities: Each week we had at least a couple of talks by external speakers, giving us insights from within the industry. That has been very valuable, the best one was somebody explaining us how to make a bot using Dialogflow, with git repo and all. Fantastic. Unfortunately, you are likely to be very fatigued by all the mental work you\\'re doing in the bootcamp to fully engage in the talks. But it is all meterial you can go back at a later stage, having had direct exposure to it, and maybe even networked with a real tech-industry specimen. And we came to job opportunities. I yet have to attend the hiring week which is organized at the end of the bootcamp and it\\'s supposed to be a kind of speed dating between us graduate and tech companies. BUT, during the last event one of the speakers gained an interest in my final project and we\\'re now exploring the prospect of remote work for his creative, amazing and well established start-up. So yes, nothing concrete yet but I can\\'t beleive the fact I\\'m actively asked for interviews even BEFORE I start searching for a job. Amazing.</p><p>Last point to address is the people. I barely been alone during these two months, the group spirit has been fantastic. From spending the night all together coding, to partying at campus on the weekends, I felt so fortunate to get to meet so many great people. On a personal note, that was even more important given the fact that I lost my father while I was attending the bootcamp. It wasn\\'t an easy decision to stay and learn coding, but it was the right choice. The understanding and support I received from the staff and the other students has been invaluable, don\\'t know what kind of place I would have been without it. </p><p>I do reccomend the course, it delivers on expectations, but be ready to push yourself as hard as you can in the learning process. There\\'s no magic, it all comes through hard work. Ironhack will provide you with the best environment, tools, knowledge, people, it\\'s like a state of the art gym: the sweat is still all yours. As for me, I might take the UX/UI bootcamp, Ironhack is kind of addictive.</p><span class=\\'read-less-text\\' style=\\'display:none;\\'><a class=\\'read-less-button\\'>Read Less</a></span></span>',\n",

       "  \"I'm 40 years old, I travelled the world and lived very intensely. Trust me if I say that the whole Ironhack bootcamp has been one the highest ranking experiences of my life. Let me explain you why.Coding is hard. Learning to code in 2 months is very demanding... Read More and does seem totally impossible. Believe it or not, the Ironhack campus in BCN is designed at every level (from the location, the building itself, the staff, the teachers, the syllabus, the events and the job opportunities) just to make that happen. It doesn't get more ideal than that. Let's address these points one by one.Location: Barcelona is one of the most international cities in Europe. You do breath modernity and opportunity here, especially in the Poplenou neighboroud where the campus is located. It has become a kind of tech district, so on the way to class you pass by real tech companies and it gives you a feel of where you might end up working. Feels like you're there already.The campus: Fantastic open space with glass walls (Kanban boards drawn on them), plants hanging from the ceiling, kitchen, showers, desks, standing desks and tons of architectonic eye candies. It's like your mind expands in there, and you're hooked. You don't want to leave. In fact you don't. You're given the keys and take advantage of the 24/7 access policy. You'll need it on project weeks!!The staff: They're doing a fantastic job at keeping the place so well organized YET very informal, frienly and welcoming. I felt like I could express myself without having to fit in to any particular mould, and that was very valuable to me, because during the bootcamp you are reinventing yourself and pushing your brain hard on coursework in order to do that. So nobody will judge you if you spend hours by a standing desk coding and dancing looking more like a dj (or a crazy person) than a developer. You're tired? You can take a nap in plain sight. Wanna play? Let's skate or play football, inside of course. Nobody will ask you to stop. The staff is committed in having you become a web developer. They know kicking a ball will help your unconcious brain solve the kata.The teachers: Andre has been one of the most inspiring and influential professional I ever met. The guy has more than 20 years of experience, and he knows how to deliver it to you. His technical knowledge is so intimate that I'm sure he natively thinks in Javascript then compiles in English for the rest of us. But it's not just that he tought us a programming language (and to love it), he focused a lot on best practices and the workflow and mindset you have to adopt in order to transform your ideas in to products through coding, and having fun in the process. Then, he passed on us so many insights drawing form his own experience, filtering out for us the most valuable. Maybe not obvious at first, but Andre insights sit on the brain and release value as time passes by. And also, it must be said: he let us appreciate how cool a fully fledged web dev can be. The teaching assistants: Ironhack employs the most suited students as teaching assistants for next cohorts. They're three, with different levels of experience depending on how many cohorts they survived. Yes, because it's not easy to stay patient having to debug horrible code by current students still not having a clue!! What you get from them is the closeness of relating with somebody who just finished the bootcamp, as well as accurate code revisions and debugging, directly from somebody who still remembers on what silly thing you're more likely to get stuck on. They were stuck there too just a couple of months before, they know how and where to help.The sillabus: Javascript is on fire nowadays and Ironhack is one of the few bootcamps to base its entire curriculum on it. Backend, frontend, all JS, because this is the present and the foreseable future of web dev. In fact, anything different would have felt like time wasting. The course is divided in three modules, each module giving you the teaching first and then challenging you on a project. The course material is constantly updated, you get exercises on a git repo to work on all night if you want. You'll get a detailed revision of your code in the morning. In the first module you learn the basics, HTML, CSS and JS, and make a late 90s style JQuerish app with it. Addictive brain gymnastics. Then you're introduced to Node.js in the second module, but server side. Mongo DB, Mongoose, Express. And you make a '00 style server rendered MVC app, which almost feels like a real thing. In the third module you're thought a Javascript framework (this time it was Angular 5), and are given two weeks to complete your own full stack project. At some point while doing it, which happens at different stages for different people, it's guaranteed that you will see the light. Like in the Karate Kid movie you'll see how all they made you do click together. Your fingers begin flying on the keyboard, translating your thoughts in to code as if it was the most natural thing in the world, while you wonder what the hell is happening. That's when a web dev has finally emerged from within you. Events and job opportunities: Each week we had at least a couple of talks by external speakers, giving us insights from within the industry. That has been very valuable, the best one was somebody explaining us how to make a bot using Dialogflow, with git repo and all. Fantastic. Unfortunately, you are likely to be very fatigued by all the mental work you're doing in the bootcamp to fully engage in the talks. But it is all meterial you can go back at a later stage, having had direct exposure to it, and maybe even networked with a real tech-industry specimen. And we came to job opportunities. I yet have to attend the hiring week which is organized at the end of the bootcamp and it's supposed to be a kind of speed dating between us graduate and tech companies. BUT, during the last event one of the speakers gained an interest in my final project and we're now exploring the prospect of remote work for his creative, amazing and well established start-up.

Es el final del segundo módulo, tengo una sensación de tristeza porque queda una semana de clase y después el proyecto de 2 semanas, más cerveza y relajando motores porque el segundo módulo fue muy arduo y doloroso.Finalmente atacamos la tercera semana, sentimos como si nos estuvieran metiendo a presión deprisa y corriendo Angular sin ser capaces de entender que significa la palabra ‘reutilizable’ pero ahí estamos en una semana aprendiendo todo lo posible aplicando Passport a nuestro proyecto, juntando todos los conocimientos que tuvimos para dar a luz a un proyecto que representaría el top de nuestro aprendizaje dejándote el sudor y rezando para que no te salga un ‘unexpected token fatal error’, para una vez más presentar tu proyecto, recibir un aplauso y…se acabó.¿De verdad, y las vivencias, gente, profesores, amigos?Si te contase las picarescas y las vivencias tanto positivas como negativas, ¿vivirías realmente lo que tienes que vivir o intentarías vivir lo que yo te contase?Sólo te daré un consejo nuevo alumno, no tengas prisa después de la hiring week, tardarán en contactarte porque así funcionan las empresas, pero finalmente te aseguro que conseguirás esa meta ansiada como es la de conseguir un buen puesto de trabajo, palabra de ironhacker.Read Less',\n",

Honestly, these reviews were what helped me make a decision and although I’ve never written a review before for anything, I knew this one I had to write.<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> I wondered what I would be writing once I finished the course; and I have to say that probably midway through the course I already knew: Just do it. <br> <br>So, this review has two parts two it: Before Ironhack and During Ironhack. I wanted to give my story so that you have some context and maybe it’s similar to your own story and helps you make a decision. And if that doesn’t matter to you, then just scroll down to the second part :)<br> <br>BEFORE IRONHACK<br> <br>Upon my college graduation (earning a degree in communications — so not technical at all), I found a job for a small company located in a WeWork while still holding a part-time job at a restaurant. At WeWork, naturally, the job feed was filled with posts for developers. I saw how much opportunity there was and I decided to play around with programming with many of the free resources online. After realizing that it was something I could pursue professionally, I decided to quit my job at the small company so that I can work full-time at the restaurant and study so that I can become a developer. (Working for a restaurant is not as mentally strenuous as an office, so I figured I can at least make a living and study.)<br> <br>Fast-forward a year.<br> <br>I was still working at the restaurant and I was still studying. I missed my personal deadlines and extended deadlines before I thought going to a bootcamp would be a good choice. I was really reluctant to do a bootcamp because, honestly, the information is freely available out there so why should anyone pay for it. But I realized that the money that I would have saved by studying on my own, I already lost. If I had done the camp sooner, I could have had a job in tech sooner and I could have made back my investment already. Granted, some people can study this own their own and that’s awesome; I, however, am not one of these people. I could say that my only regret is that I didn’t do this sooner, but, honestly, I’m glad I ended up in the cohort I did because I met some amazing people that greatly impacted my experience. <br> <br>DURING IRONHACK<br> <br>Oh man. The first week wasn’t bad. We went over material that I had covered on my own so I felt pretty confident. The week after that? Yeah, things got harder. What’s interesting about the experience is that some concepts will just click and you’ll feel good about what you learned that day. Other days, some concepts just won’t click and you’ll leave with a pounding headache and feeling defeated. But you’ll come back the next day. You’ll go over that concept again — while learning a new one — and you’ll keep doing that. Eventually, it just clicks — but I really have to give thanks to Nizar, our instructor, for helping that happen. Nizar knew our weak points and knew what he was going to have to go over and over again. Sometimes he sounded repetitive, but the man knew what he was doing.<br> <br>A little more about Nizar — he is an incredibly talented teacher. When you ask him questions, he won’t just give you the answer. He’ll guide you so that you arrive to the answer. And like I mentioned before, he knows students’ trouble spots. Sometimes he would jump through certain bits of the curriculum because he knew it would be better for our learning. He was even willing to give us extra time — during our final project week, we stayed with some of us until midnight helping put out all our fires. He didn’t have to do that. And I think the other amazing thing is that he was always encouraging you. He could tell that sometimes I would get frustrated, and he would just remind me kindly/matter-of-factly, “It’s going to get easier with time.”<br> <br>The rest of the staff at Ironhack is amazing too. They’re all so interested in making sure that you have the best possible experience; granted, it\\'s in their best interest to put out the best quality product, but they work hard at it and they know you’re here to change your life and they don’t take that lightly. They do weekly surveys so that they can constantly improve. They don’t just treat you like customers but like friends, sharing with you about their lives and experiences. And overall, they’re just genuine people which adds positivity to the environment.<br> <br>Another staff member you’ll be interacting a lot with is Brito. He’s going to become more important later on in the course as you start getting ready to go to market. And, of course, he becomes really important as you actually go to market. The guy has a ton of connections (and he wants you to exploit them) and he is there to help you (and he will help you) — you just have to do your homework. (Some students got hired before we even graduated because of his contacts.) He is also the guy to tell it like it is — and that’s exactly what you want with someone who is supposed to help you land a job.<br> <br>Another amazing thing about Ironhack is the environment. But again, the environment is founded on the people. You get to go everyday to this awesome co-working space surrounded by like-minded individuals. People who have decided to make a change in their lives and just go for it. That momentum is was catapulted my learning. I had peers who I could turn to when I needed help or they turned to me for help. You have an amazing support group for when you’re down and wonderful people to laugh with when you need a little break when you’re staying until 10 or 11 pm coding away. It’s really hard to find that and Ironhack has found it.<br> <br>Overall, I wouldn’t trade my experience at Ironhack for anything. The environment is awesome, the staff is awesome, and the material is awesome. But the most important thing I learned (and I know you’ve already read this) is how to learn. Even with that year that I spent learning on my own and even taking a paid course at MDC, I learned more at Ironhack after the first week. This is just the tip of the iceberg and there is so much more to learn, but now I can build and learn while I do it. Do research, make a change, and give it your all.

       "  \"WARNING: This is the longest review ever. \\r\\n \\r\\nAll right. I've been pretty excited to write this review. Honestly, these reviews were what helped me make a decision and although I’ve never written a review before for anything, I knew this one I had to write. I wondered what I would be writing once I finished the course; and I have to say that probably midway through the course I already knew: Just do it. \\r\\n \\r\\nSo, this review has two parts two it: Before Ironhack and During Ironhack. I wanted to give my story so that you have some context and maybe it’s similar to your own story and helps you make a decision. And if that doesn’t matter to you, then just scroll down to the second part :)\\r\\n \\r\\nBEFORE IRONHACK\\r\\n \\r\\nUpon my college graduation (earning a degree in communications — so not technical at all), I found a job for a small company located in a WeWork while still holding a part-time job at a restaurant. At WeWork, naturally, the job feed was filled with posts for developers. I saw how much opportunity there was and I decided to play around with programming with many of the free resources online. After realizing that it was something I could pursue professionally, I decided to quit my job at the small company so that I can work full-time at the restaurant and study so that I can become a developer. (Working for a restaurant is not as mentally strenuous as an office, so I figured I can at least make a living and study.)\\r\\n \\r\\nFast-forward a year.\\r\\n \\r\\nI was still working at the restaurant and I was still studying. I missed my personal deadlines and extended deadlines before I thought going to a bootcamp would be a good choice. I was really reluctant to do a bootcamp because, honestly, the information is freely available out there so why should anyone pay for it. But I realized that the money that I would have saved by studying on my own, I already lost. If I had done the camp sooner, I could have had a job in tech sooner and I could have made back my investment already. Granted, some people can study this own their own and that’s awesome; I, however, am not one of these people.

After about a year of debating whether I wanted to make a career change, I found Ironhack. I put my fear aside and reached out to ask for a campus tour here in Miami to get the ball rolling.</p><p>Application Process: The first person I met at Ironhack was Alia, and Alia does NOT dissapoint! I felt such a great energy from her and genuine interest in getting to know me and understanding why I wanted to join their program. Shortly after, I applied and scheduled my three interviews (general interview with admissions, career interview with Brito, and a technical interview where you must solve a coding challenge). All three interviews went great (again...the only experience I had was working with developers, but never the actual coding aspect). The moment I received a phone call from Alia that I was accepted into the program I immediately felt two things: extreme excitement with a side of fear of \"what did I just get myself into.\"</p><p>Cohort (9 weeks): The structure of the class is exactly as they describe it on the site. Grab your coffee in the morning, learn, code, lunch, learn and code (did I mention the coffee is free and unlimited?!). What really made the course, though, was our instructor Nizar and we were so lucky to have him! The way he explains the concepts is very clear for the most part and, to someone with no coding experience, I was able to understand what he was teaching. He never says no when you need help, and what\\'s great about it is that he doesn\\'t just hand the answers to you. He makes you think about what it is you\\'re doing and what you need to do to get there. Now, I\\'m not saying your journey will be easy, because it won\\'t be. You need to put in the time inside and outside of class to make sure you\\'re not falling behind. The course moves quickly, so it\\'s very easy to fall behind if you\\'re not keeping up. You will feel like (and I can only speak from the perspective of someone with zero coding experience), \"Holy crap, there is an entire universe of coding that I did not know about,\" but don\\'t get overwhelmed! Don\\'t let it discourage you, but do expect to be learning for the rest of your life as we all know how quickly technology can change. </p><p>Finding a job: Brito, the recruitment manager at Ironhack, is also someone you will meet and never forget. Keep in mind, he is not there to hand you a guaranteed job on a silver platter at the end of the cohort - and he will make that very clear. He does a great job of coaching you on what networking events you should attend, what you need in your LinkedIn and in your resume, and is available whenever if you have any questions or need help. There is also a hiring fair where companies come in to sit and interview with you, I have yet to experience it as our fair is not until January, but it\\'s great to know that we get the opportunity (thanks to Brito) to have that chance of \"speed-dating\" with several companies who are looking to hire.</p><p>Overall, my experience was amazing. I don\\'t regret making the jump and am lucky to have been able to attend Ironhack. For the past 9 weeks it never felt like I was going to \"school\" and I was always excited to go in the next day to learn something new. The environment, staff and vibe of Ironhack was the cherry on top and I\\'m so glad that I chose to stay in Miami and attend their course. If you\\'re reading this and you\\'re still wondering whether you should apply....just do yourself a favor and do it already :).</p><span class=\\'read-less-text\\' style=\\'display:none;\\'><a class=\\'read-less-button\\'>Read Less</a></span></span>',\n",

Don\\'t let it discourage you, but do expect to be learning for the rest of your life as we all know how quickly technology can change. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinding a job: Brito, the recruitment manager at Ironhack, is also someone you will meet and never forget. Keep in mind, he is not there to hand you a guaranteed job on a silver platter at the end of the cohort - and he will make that very clear. He does a great job of coaching you on what networking events you should attend, what you need in your LinkedIn and in your resume, and is available whenever if you have any questions or need help. There is also a hiring fair where companies come in to sit and interview with you, I have yet to experience it as our fair is not until January, but it\\'s great to know that we get the opportunity (thanks to Brito) to have that chance of \"speed-dating\" with several companies who are looking to hire.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, my experience was amazing. I don\\'t regret making the jump and am lucky to have been able to attend Ironhack. For the past 9 weeks it never felt like I was going to \"school\" and I was always excited to go in the next day to learn something new. The environment, staff and vibe of Ironhack was the cherry on top and I\\'m so glad that I chose to stay in Miami and attend their course. If you\\'re reading this and you\\'re still wondering whether you should apply....just do yourself a favor and do it already :).',\n",

       "  'If you\\'re wondering whether you should join a coding bootcamp (and you are GENUINELY interested in pursuing it), stop what you\\'re doing and APPLY RIGHT NOW. The reason I write the above first is because that is what I saw in several reviews I had read... Read More when searching for the right bootcamp. Yet, every time I would always think to myself, \"Is that really the truth, though? Will I regret making the jump?\" So before I write the rest of my review, I can tell you that those reviews were right!Before joining Ironhack, I was working at a digital marketing company in operations and product development (and before then I had just graduated with a bachelor in Architecture), so clearly I had zero coding experience prior to Ironhack. After about a year of debating whether I wanted to make a career change, I found Ironhack. I put my fear aside and reached out to ask for a campus tour here in Miami to get the ball rolling.Application Process: The first person I met at Ironhack was Alia, and Alia does NOT dissapoint! I felt such a great energy from her and genuine interest in getting to know me and understanding why I wanted to join their program. Shortly after, I applied and scheduled my three interviews (general interview with admissions, career interview with Brito, and a technical interview where you must solve a coding challenge). All three interviews went great (again...the only experience I had was working with developers, but never the actual coding aspect). The moment I received a phone call from Alia that I was accepted into the program I immediately felt two things: extreme excitement with a side of fear of \"what did I just get myself into.\"Cohort (9 weeks): The structure of the class is exactly as they describe it on the site. Grab your coffee in the morning, learn, code, lunch, learn and code (did I mention the coffee is free and unlimited?!). What really made the course, though, was our instructor Nizar and we were so lucky to have him! The way he explains the concepts is very clear for the most part and, to someone with no coding experience, I was able to understand what he was teaching. He never says no when you need help, and what\\'s great about it is that he doesn\\'t just hand the answers to you. He makes you think about what it is you\\'re doing and what you need to do to get there. Now, I\\'m not saying your journey will be easy, because it won\\'t be. You need to put in the time inside and outside of class to make sure you\\'re not falling behind. The course moves quickly, so it\\'s very easy to fall behind if you\\'re not keeping up. You will feel like (and I can only speak from the perspective of someone with zero coding experience), \"Holy crap, there is an entire universe of coding that I did not know about,\" but don\\'t get overwhelmed!

I think there was only one person in the cohort who had a degree related to computer science, other than that person, no one including myself had a computer science background. We still succeeded, in just 9 weeks we already had 3 projects under our belt and being able to do full stack apps on our own. </span></p><p>Much of what makes Ironhack what it is, is how the faculty interacts with each other and with the students. Their work culture is so amazing, they have a special type of relationship, nothing like I have ever seen before. Of course this translates to the students. The staff develops a relationship with the students and in my opinion this improves experience so much.</p><p>The learning doesn\\'t stop there. At least for me, I took to learning other things during my free time. Things that weren\\'t necessarily part of the curriculum, but I wanted to take advantage of having an instructor to which I could ask anything any time (literally any time. My instuctor would get back to me on Sundays! ). </p><p>Ironhack gives you all the tools you need to succeed. From how to write amazing software, to what to say to future employers (more of this below). Like anything in life the you have to do the work, but my Ironhack family definitly made so much possible. The most important tool that I learned at Ironhack was how to \"LEARN\". You can\\'t expect to become a the best developer in 9 weeks, but you can expect you will graduate with knowledge on how to become one! If you put in the work, I can guarantee you this. </p><p>Nizar, our lead instructor is the man! The guy is legit one of the smartest people I\\'ve met, and one of the most patient as well! Trust me, dealing with me is no easy task. However, he was always there for me, and like I mentioned above, he even answered my questions on a Sunday. Rarely (very rarely) will he give you the answer to your problems directly, he does much more for you, he tells you how to be resourceful and where to look or something along those lines. You end up solving the problem on your own and because of this, you learn so much more. The whole teaching staff is amazing, Ironhack always have great T.A.s. Our T.A. Dappered dan was the man. He was also always accessible.</p><p>The experience does not end there. At Ironhack, they have a placement manager. His name is Daniel Brito. What do you need to know? Brito is one of the most connected people I\\'ve ever met. Everyone in the South Florida Tech ecosystem ( maybe all of South Florida ) knows who Brito is. His background makes him the most qualified person for the role. His been on both sides of the table when it comes to hiring. If you decide to take the course, make sure you follow his every word. Why? Well I did, and I had a job before the cohort ended. He will also never write your resume for you or give you an answer directly, but you can expect the most detailed feedback you could ever imagine. He knows exactly what employers look for and will get you to where you need to be if you put in the work!</p><p>I can comfortably say Ironhack that has changed my life and I am very grateful for this!</p><span class=\\'read-less-text\\' style=\\'display:none;\\'><a class=\\'read-less-button\\'>Read Less</a></span></span>',\n",

Brito is one of the most connected people I\\'ve ever met. Everyone in the South Florida Tech ecosystem ( maybe all of South Florida ) knows who Brito is. His background makes him the most qualified person for the role. His been on both sides of the table when it comes to hiring. If you decide to take the course, make sure you follow his every word. Why? Well I did, and I had a job before the cohort ended.

Alia had contacted me back within about 15 minutes, and I was scheduled to come in a few days later.

       "  '<span class=\"truncatable\"><p>I first heard about Ironhack because I lived close to their Miami campus and saw they were having a workshop on HTML/CSS. I had done some basic web dev back in school but hadn\\'t touched it in years. Being in the classroom for the workshop brought back<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> all the fun I had in initially building awful looking myspace pages and the like using only a laptop. I was hooked.</span></p><p>I soon applied for the full-stack web bootcamp, leaving a good job at the time because I knew this bootcamp would take me in the direction I wanted to go. I wanted to be able to build applications to help my teams and clients, and knew that I had enough curiosity and perseverance to actually likely make it happen.</p><p>This bootcamp is no walk in the park. I quit my job, didn\\'t go out with friends, and focused as much of my energy as humanly possible on grasping the changing concepts. Each day we had a morning lesson, exercises, an afternoon lesson, and then a night project. While instructors did help those in the class that were falling behind, the class moves fast and you have to give it your all to progress. The instructors were not only an intelligent, hardworking group, they took care of each question that came about, and often stayed after hours to help with projects, going far above and beyond. The classmates were a driven bunch. It was exciting seeing each person, coming from vastly different backgrounds, excelling and struggling at different stages.</p><p>After the bootcamp, we all make one final application during a 2 week sprint, and then present these to Ironhack and the community, a group of maybe 80-100. Afterwards networking happens and then its on you! </p><p>I found a full stack web developer role a few months after graduation, through a recruiter friend of mine from back home. This did require me moving back to Philadelphia from Miami, which was a little sad but it is a reality. Please don\\'t assume that you will immediately find a job right where you studied, you may have to pick up and move to find something!</p><p>In conclusion, I highly recommend the Ironhack experience.

I quit my job, didn't go out with friends, and focused as much of my energy as humanly possible on grasping the changing concepts. Each day we had a morning lesson, exercises, an afternoon lesson, and then a night project. While instructors did help those in the class that were falling behind, the class moves fast and you have to give it your all to progress. The instructors were not only an intelligent, hardworking group, they took care of each question that came about, and often stayed after hours to help with projects, going far above and beyond. The classmates were a driven bunch. It was exciting seeing each person, coming from vastly different backgrounds, excelling and struggling at different stages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the bootcamp, we all make one final application during a 2 week sprint, and then present these to Ironhack and the community, a group of maybe 80-100. Afterwards networking happens and then its on you! \\r\\n\\r\\nI found a full stack web developer role a few months after graduation, through a recruiter friend of mine from back home. This did require me moving back to Philadelphia from Miami, which was a little sad but it is a reality. Please don't assume that you will immediately find a job right where you studied, you may have to pick up and move to find something!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend the Ironhack experience.

True, the learning process is exhilarating at times and painful at other, but always keep the faith that with time and practice you will progress, understand and succeed. </p><p>A bootcamp can fit many profiles from total newbies (as the former me) to people with some knowledge of computer science or that have already dabbled with programming. Hence, our cohort was quite heterogeneous in terms of levels and goals, but it created a healthy emulation where co-students and assistants were always supportive to students that were most challenged.</p><p>Ultimately, as a student I am amazed by how much we have learned and achieved in a span of only 9 weeks.

Ironhack has been able to build relationships with major companies and industry leaders that you can easily leverage once you are a member of the Ironhack family; student or alumni. If landing a job as a developer after taking the course is your goal (which it should be), skill alone will not get your foot in the door (unless you are gifted with genius level abilities). You also have to network and make yourself be known in the eyes of the community and Ironhack is your ticket into it.Daniel Brito and Nizar Khalife are invaluable resources that make Ironhack what it is and make worth the cost of the bootcamp. However, they are not alone in making Ironhack the machine that it is. The rest of the staff are an absolute joy and you will never feel like you are just another dollar in the pockets of another organization. Everyone is extremely hands on and will go above and beyond to ensure that your experience is one that promotes your success.In my eyes, Ironhack is by far the best coding camp in South Florida that provides you will all the tools and resources needed to get a return on your investment.Read Less',\n",

You do that by making a daily schedule (as in, 5-7 days a week) where you spend at least a few hours each day learning to code and problem solve using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on your own. Keep this up for a few weeks and you’ll get a better idea as to whether this is something you’d enjoy doing as a full-time job or not.

       "  'Ironhack has been a life-changing experience.I was a business controller two years ago and even though I liked numbers there was something missing, it wasn’t ringing the right bell. So I thought of what I really enjoyed and what I was good at and also... Read More what challenges I would have liked. I had some small programming knowledge related to my nerdy childhood and expanding it and making a life out if it sounded like a dream, then it became my plan. I started Ironhack with a strong will but not a final idea of what I could do with it. From day 1 it has been 360 degrees full-on experience. Every day there was an awesome tech event that I wouldn’t want to miss, technical challenges that I wanted to conquer and a bunch of like-minded people that made everything so fun and enjoyable, even the long nights before delivering the projects. I was lucky that Ironhack became my family away from home, both my colleagues, the teachers and the staff.I was the one studying non-stop but the teachers directed my struggles in the right way, showing me how I should work and where I should focus and help me when I felt lost. I tried studying online on my own before the boot camp but I never got near an inch of the results I got out of the course. I gave it my best and I got the same in return. Ironhack taught me a lot about perseverance, and how to solve problems and code bugs in a way that I couldn’t have thought of it before. It made me push through a lot of documentation and it was just what I needed to learn and to be able to improve and learn on my own after the course. Ironhack showed me where and how the magic happens and taught me how to make some myself and I can’t wait to see just how far I’ll go from here.Read Less',\n",

       "  '<span class=\"truncatable\"><p>I attended the Ironhack Part-time Web Development Bootcamp in Madrid. An intense 6-month zero-to-hero program for anyone wanting to open their mind to the exciting world of web development.</p><p>My initial knowledge of the technology stack in the curriculum<span class=\"read-more-text\">... <a class=\"read-more-button\">Read More</a></span><span class=\"read-more\" style=\"display:none;\"> was basically null, but I was starting a position as Software Engineer at an up-and-coming startup in Madrid, and I needed to learn as much as I could as fast as I could. Ironhack proved to be just the right thing for me. For the sake of organizing the review, I\\'d like to split it in three parts: the Curriculum, the Experience, and the Staff.</span></p><p>1. The Curriculum<br>I do not want to get too deep into this because it has changed quite a bit since I did the course. My class was the last of the Ruby on Rails Generation. Nonetheless, the course was generic and conceptual enough that using other technologies, such as Node.js in my case at work, proved to be quite easy. They have since changed their curriculum to Node.js, which is a great idea in my opinion. You will come out having a broad enough knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be able to tackle the coolest web-dev projects you find on Github and, as well as a great notion on working with databases. You will definitely have the skillset necessary to build your own projects from scratch as well. I think the best way to define the learning process at Ironhack is that you gain the ability to explore and master the tools you need to build a web application. The stack they may use is no limiting factor. In essence, you get the wings you need to fly on your own through the web-dev universe.</p><p>2. The Experience<br>It\\'s intense. Even the part-time plan is challenging and demanding. For 6 months you will have to be strongly committed to the course, because how much you learn will depende entirely on you. Ironhack will provide the tools you need to get as far as you want to go, but the effort has to be there. The pacing is neither too fast, nor too slow, although you do have to work at home a bit if you want to keep up. If you come from a totally different background, or are writing your first lines of code, you\\'ll probably need to work harder than people who are more familiar with code. But fear not, you will have awesome support from your classmates and teachers. You will be spending two days from 18 to 21, and Saturdays from 9 to 17 at Ironhack, so be prepared. Balancing the course with a full time job and your personal life is definitely possible, but you will certainly need the willpower to do it.

       "  \"I attended the Ironhack Part-time Web Development Bootcamp in Madrid. An intense 6-month zero-to-hero program for anyone wanting to open their mind to the exciting world of web development.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy initial knowledge of the technology stack in the curriculum was basically null, but I was starting a position as Software Engineer at an up-and-coming startup in Madrid, and I needed to learn as much as I could as fast as I could. Ironhack proved to be just the right thing for me. For the sake of organizing the review, I'd like to split it in three parts: the Curriculum, the Experience, and the Staff.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The Curriculum\\r\\nI do not want to get too deep into this because it has changed quite a bit since I did the course. My class was the last of the Ruby on Rails Generation. Nonetheless, the course was generic and conceptual enough that using other technologies, such as Node.js in my case at work, proved to be quite easy. They have since changed their curriculum to Node.js, which is a great idea in my opinion. You will come out having a broad enough knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be able to tackle the coolest web-dev projects you find on Github and, as well as a great notion on working with databases. You will definitely have the skillset necessary to build your own projects from scratch as well. I think the best way to define the learning process at Ironhack is that you gain the ability to explore and master the tools you need to build a web application. The stack they may use is no limiting factor.  In essence, you get the wings you need to fly on your own through the web-dev universe.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The Experience\\r\\nIt's intense. Even the part-time  plan is challenging and demanding. For 6 months you will have to be strongly committed to the course, because how much you learn will depende entirely on you. Ironhack will provide the tools you need to get as far as you want to go, but the effort has to be there. The pacing is neither too fast, nor too slow, although you do have to work at home a bit if you want to keep up. If you come from a totally different background, or are writing your first lines of code, you'll probably need to work harder than people who are more familiar with code. But fear not, you will have awesome support from your classmates and teachers.  You will be spending two days from 18 to 21, and Saturdays from 9 to 17 at Ironhack, so be prepared. Balancing the course with a full time job and your personal life is definitely possible, but you will certainly need the willpower to do it. The structure has changed since I did the course, I believe now it is more project based (three projects in total), and at the end you get to share your creations with your mates and with people from all over the community that come to the Hackshow. \\r\\n\\r\\n3.
